**Buffalo Sabres 0 - 4 Toronto Maple Leafs**  
Maple Leafs clinch Atlantic Division with shutout win against Sabres 
 **BUFFALO** \-\- <forge-entity title="Anthony Stolarz" slug="anthony-stolarz-8476932" code="player">Anthony Stolarz</forge-entity> made 35 saves for the Toronto Maple Leafs, who clinched first place in the Atlantic Division with a 4-0 win against the Buffalo Sabres at KeyBank Center on Tuesday. 
“It's huge (to win the division),” Stolarz said. “I mean, to be able to start the \[Stanley Cup\] Playoffs on home ice, in front of our home fans, it's massive for us. You get that last change, you get that Game 7 home ice, so it's quite an accomplishment for this group, and we're super excited about it.”

It was the second straight shutout for Stolarz, who stopped 15 shots in a 1-0 overtime win against the Montreal Canadiens on Saturday. He has three shutouts in his past four games and hasn’t allowed a goal in a career-long 132:27.

“I feel good,” said Stolarz, who has won eight straight starts. “But I think at the end of the day, I think the guys are really committing to a complete two-way game up and down the ice. I mean, you look at all the blocked shots, the way guys are sacrificing their body right now, the backcheck. It's what it's \[going to\] take to go far in the playoffs. I just think that we have to continue this trend.” 
<forge-entity title="Auston Matthews" slug="auston-matthews-8479318" code="player">Auston Matthews</forge-entity> scored his 400th NHL goal, and <forge-entity title="Mitch Marner" slug="mitchell-marner-8478483" code="player">Mitch Marner</forge-entity> scored to reach 100 points (27 goals, 73 assists) in a season for the first time in his NHL career for the Maple Leafs (51-26-4), who have won four in a row and will face the Ottawa Senators in the first round. Ottawa is the first wild card in the Eastern Conference.

“It means lot,” Matthews, the Toronto captain, said of his milestone. “Obviously this group's been really supportive all year. And individual awards are nice; I think it's nice to check off certain things, obviously. But the focus is still on the team and doing what's best for the team and continue to put our best foot forward here, one more game and then the postseason. So, we've just got to stay focused and stay dialed in mentally on our game and on the guys in this room.”

<forge-entity title="Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen" slug="ukko-pekka-luukkonen-8480045" code="player">Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen</forge-entity> made 28 saves for the Sabres (35-39-7), who are 0-3-1 after a five-game winning streak.

“We left a lot of good chances out there,” Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff said. “Tight game. It was a hard-fought game. We were doing a lot of good stuff against those two top lines and we were generating enough to win it. … Second period, we left too many chances there.”

<forge-entity title="Steven Lorentz" slug="steven-lorentz-8478904" code="player">Steven Lorentz</forge-entity> gave Toronto a 1-0 lead at 14:15 of the second period, beating Luukkonen with a one-timer from the left hash marks off a backhanded pass from <forge-entity title="Scott Laughton" slug="scott-laughton-8476872" code="player">Scott Laughton</forge-entity> in the left corner. 
Marner one-timed a cross-crease pass from Matthews at the bottom of the right circle to make it 2-0 at 15:39 of the third period.

“It's a special thing, for sure,” Marner said of reaching 100 points. “Those accomplishments don't happen by yourself, and that's just credit to a lot of guys in that locker room that have helped me out and supported me through this year and made some unbelievable plays for me and have put some in from my passes. I think the really cool thing is just the excitement from the guys for that point and seeing their excitement for me, so that was really cool just to experience.”

Matthews scored an empty-net goal to push it to 3-0 at 18:08 after Marner passed up an open shot to find him. He’s the second player in Maple Leafs history to score 400 goals, after <forge-entity title="Mats Sundin" slug="mats-sundin-8451774" code="player">Mats Sundin</forge-entity> (420).

“\[Marner has\] definitely set up quite a few of those,” Matthews said. “In the end it's a team accomplishment, I think. I mean it's a team sport. There's a lot that goes into it, and I'm just fortunate that it's come off my stick a couple of times.” 
<forge-entity title="Nicholas Robertson" slug="nicholas-robertson-8481582" code="player">Nicholas Robertson</forge-entity> roofed a backhand at 18:43 for the 4-0 final.

“They played pretty patient,” Sabres forward <forge-entity title="Jason Zucker" slug="jason-zucker-8475722" code="player">Jason Zucker</forge-entity> said. “We still had our looks. ‘Upie’ played really, really well tonight. Kept us in the game for a long time. We didn’t capitalize, and then we gave up too much at the end of the game there.”

**NOTES**: Matthews is the sixth-fastest player in NHL history to 400 goals (628 games), behind <forge-entity title="Wayne Gretzky" slug="wayne-gretzky-8447400" code="player">Wayne Gretzky</forge-entity> (436 games), <forge-entity title="Mike Bossy" slug="mike-bossy-8445611" code="player">Mike Bossy</forge-entity> (506), <forge-entity title="Mario Lemieux" slug="mario-lemieux-8448782" code="player">Mario Lemieux</forge-entity> (508), <forge-entity title="Brett Hull" slug="brett-hull-8448091" code="player">Brett Hull</forge-entity> (520) and <forge-entity title="Jari Kurri" slug="jari-kurri-8448569" code="player">Jari Kurri</forge-entity> (608). … Marner is the fourth player in Maple Leafs history with 100 points in a season, after Doug Gilmour, Darryl Sittler, and Matthews. … Toronto clinched its division title for third time in the NHL’s expansion era (since 1967-68). … Toronto won its 25th road game of the season, the most in franchise history. … Buffalo had won seven straight at home.

**Ottawa Senators 3 - 4 Chicago Blackhawks**  
The Chicago Blackhawks secured a 4-3 overtime victory against the Ottawa Senators thanks to Frank Nazar's goal just 48 seconds into OT. Nazar, who has shown significant improvement over the past 20 games, extended his goal streak to three games by one-timing a pass from Connor Bedard past Ottawa's Anton Forsberg. Nazar had also netted the shootout winner in a game against Montreal the previous day. Connor Bedard contributed significantly with two goals and an assist, reaching a career high of 23 goals for the season and finishing with 128 career points as a teenager, surpassing Bobby Carpenter for the seventh-most in NHL history. The Blackhawks' Spencer Knight made 34 saves, crucially keeping them in the game. Despite being outshot 37-16, Chicago managed to hold off Ottawa, who had impressive performances from Thomas Chabot and Drake Batherson, both extending their point streaks to six games.

**Philadelphia Flyers 0 - 3 Columbus Blue Jackets**  
Blue Jackets shut out Flyers, push race for 2nd wild card in East to Game 82
 **PHILADELPHIA --** <forge-entity title="Jet Greaves" slug="jet-greaves-8482982" code="player">Jet Greaves</forge-entity> made 29 saves for the Columbus Blue Jackets, who stayed in contention for the Stanley Cup Playoffs with a 3-0 win against the Philadelphia Flyers at Wells Fargo Center on Tuesday. 
The Blue Jackets (39-33-9) are two points behind the Montreal Canadiens for the second wild card from the Eastern Conference. They can still reach the postseason if the Canadiens lose to the Carolina Hurricanes in regulation on Wednesday and they then defeat the New York Islanders at home Thursday.

"We knew a lot of things had to happen for us to make the playoffs, and we're just trying to do our part, and we're doing a great job of it," Blue Jackets forward <forge-entity title="Adam Fantilli" slug="adam-fantilli-8484166" code="player">Adam Fantilli</forge-entity> said. "We've had great goaltending stepping up. Everybody's been playing great, so it's really good to see."

<forge-entity title="Dante Fabbro" slug="dante-fabbro-8479371" code="player">Dante Fabbro</forge-entity>, <forge-entity title="Kent Johnson" slug="kent-johnson-8482660" code="player">Kent Johnson</forge-entity> and Fantilli scored for Columbus, which won its fifth straight game. <forge-entity title="Sean Monahan" slug="sean-monahan-8477497" code="player">Sean Monahan</forge-entity> and <forge-entity title="Zach Werenski" slug="zach-werenski-8478460" code="player">Zach Werenski</forge-entity> each had two assists.

"I think the guys are just playing great," Greaves said. "They're doing a great job in front of me, making my job pretty simple. I think it's been a team effort. Obviously, it's an important time of the year. These games matter a lot, but I think all the guys have been doing a great job." 
<forge-entity title="Samuel Ersson" slug="samuel-ersson-8481035" code="player">Samuel Ersson</forge-entity> made 31 saves for Philadelphia (33-38-10), which had been 5-1-1 in its previous seven games. The Flyers have been eliminated from playoff contention.

"I thought our start was good," Flyers coach Brad Shaw said. "I thought we started a lot like we have the other games recently. I just didn't think we had the resilience. I don't think we had the ability to stay with it and thought they sort of pulled away the second half of the game."

Fabbro put the Blue Jackets ahead 1-0 at 2:32 of the second period with a slap shot from the top of the right face-off circle.

"\[Werenski\] and I actually talked in between the first and second about some space we had saw coming off the draw and allow him to walk and kind of make a read and I'd just kind of slipped in behind him," Fabbro said. "He made the read to pass it over to me and I stepped in a couple feet and was able to shoot it." 
That goal was all Greaves needed. Making his fourth straight start, he improved to 4-0-0 with a 0.75 goals-against average, .976 save percentage and two shutouts.

"He might be the hottest guy in the NHL right now," Fantilli said. "He's got one goal against him last three games, and it's \[<forge-entity title="Alex Ovechkin" slug="alex-ovechkin-8471214" code="player">Alex Ovechkin</forge-entity>\]. I mean, that's pretty good. There's not much else you can say."

Greaves said he's the beneficiary of strong defensive play.

"I think just doing a really good job in front of the net, boxing out, clearing away secondary plays, obviously spending a lot of time in the offensive zone, scoring a lot of goals," he said. "I could go on and on. They're doing a great job."

Johnson made it 2-0 with a power-play goal at 17:01, one-timing a seam pass from Monahan from the right face-off dot past Ersson. 
The Flyers had chances to get back into the game but went 0-for-3 on the power play.

"I think there were some chances, we just didn't finish," Flyers forward <forge-entity title="Sean Couturier" slug="sean-couturier-8476461" code="player">Sean Couturier</forge-entity> said. "I think we're trying to play a little too skilled, we were a lot of one-and-done's. We get pucks there but there's not much traffic or we're trying to be on the outside and trying to make plays. Sometimes we've got to simplify it and get some dirty goals. We can't always expect to make highlight reel goals."

Fantilli's 30th goal of the season made it 3-0 at 13:26 of the third period. He was skating to the net when <forge-entity title="Kirill Marchenko" slug="kirill-marchenko-8480893" code="player">Kirill Marchenko</forge-entity>'s shot deflected off his knee.

It was the fifth goal during a three-game goal streak for Fantilli, who had left the team Monday to travel to Toronto for the funeral of his grandfather.

"Yesterday I flew back to Toronto and buried my grandfather," Fantilli said. "His favorite team was Philly. It's going to sound like I'm joking when I say that, but I swear his favorite team was Philly. And coming back, I'm pretty sure that one was him just giving me a lucky bounce there." 
**NOTES:** The Blue Jackets now have 261 goals, the most they've scored in a season. Their previous high was 258 goals in 2021-22. ... Johnson's goal gave him seven points (two goals, five assists) during a five-game point streak. ... Monahan (two goals, five assists) and Werenski (two goals, four assists) each extended his point streak to five games. ... Philadelphia had its four-game home winning streak end.

**New York Islanders 1 - 3 Washington Capitals**  
The Washington Capitals secured a 3-1 victory over the New York Islanders, highlighted by Dylan Strome's impressive hat trick, marking his first since March 2022 and contributing to his career-high 29-goal season. Strome's scoring prowess was complemented by solid goaltending from Charlie Lindgren, who made 32 saves, helping Washington break a two-game losing streak and clinch first place in the Metropolitan Division. The Islanders' Jean-Gabriel Pageau scored their lone goal, as they continued to struggle, losing four of their last five games and being already out of playoff contention. The game's pivotal moments included Strome's early power-play goal, a disallowed Islanders goal due to a hand pass, and Strome sealing the win with an empty-netter. Head coach Spencer Carbery praised Strome's contribution, while Lindgren expressed the importance of this win as the Capitals prepare for the playoffs. Notably, Alex Ovechkin extended his point streak to eight games, and the Capitals played without key defensemen John Carlson and Jakob Chychrun due to maintenance.

**St Louis Blues 6 - 1 Utah Hockey Club**

This win at the Enterprise Center was pivotal, ensuring their playoff berth without relying on other game results.

The Blues were propelled by a franchise-record 12-game winning streak, and Robert Thomas extended his point streak to 12 games, despite leaving the game with a precautionary injury. Despite being behind for a playoff spot earlier, the Blues rallied to finish the regular season strong, extending their home-winning streak to 12 games. They now face a challenging playoff matchup against the Central Division's top team, the Winnipeg Jets. On Utah's side, Clayton Keller scored the lone goal. Although Utah ended the season strongly, they couldn't overcome the Blues' formidable play on the night.

**Calgary Flames 5 - 4 Vegas Golden Knights**

Nazem Kadri, Morgan Frost, Mikael Backlund, and Adam Klapka were key contributors for Calgary, extending their point streak to seven games, while goalie Dustin Wolf made 38 saves. On the other side, Brandon Saad had a standout performance with a goal and two assists as the Golden Knights prepared to face the Wild in the Western Conference First Round.
