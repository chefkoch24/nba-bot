**Tampa Bay Lightning 3 - 2 Carolina Hurricanes**  
Brayden Point scored with just 52 seconds left in the third period to secure a 3-2 victory for the Tampa Bay Lightning against the Carolina Hurricanes at Amalie Arena. Point received a precision pass from Nikita Kucherov and executed a quick snap shot to beat Carolina's goalie Pyotr Kochetkov. This win broke Tampa Bay's four-game losing streak, with additional goals from Brandon Hagel and Nick Paul, while goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy made 30 saves. Carolina, with goals from Jordan Staal and Andrei Svechnikov, also played commendably, but coach Rod Brind’Amour expressed disappointment over losing such a hard-fought game. An interesting highlight was Brent Burns playing his 884th consecutive game, tying him for sixth-most consecutive games played all-time.

**Boston Bruins 0 - 4 Edmonton Oilers**  
Skinner stops 26, Oilers shut out Bruins for 4th win in row
 <forge-entity title="Stuart Skinner" slug="stuart-skinner-8479973" code="player">Stuart Skinner</forge-entity> made 26 saves, and <forge-entity title="Adam Henrique" slug="adam-henrique-8474641" code="player">Adam Henrique</forge-entity> scored twice for the Edmonton Oilers in a 4-0 win against the Boston Bruins at TD Garden in Boston on Tuesday. 
Skinner was not awarded the shutout after being taken off the ice by a concussion spotter and missing the final 5:25 of the first period following a collision with Boston defenseman <forge-entity title="Nikita Zadorov" slug="nikita-zadorov-8477507" code="player">Nikita Zadorov</forge-entity>, who was called for goaltender interference. He was replaced by <forge-entity title="Calvin Pickard" slug="calvin-pickard-8475717" code="player">Calvin Pickard</forge-entity>, who did not face a shot. Skinner then returned to start the second period.

“Honestly, it’s a smart call. He got me pretty good, I think that’s, like, the fifth hit I’ve got this year,” Skinner said. “He apologized after, at the start of the second period, which was really nice of him to do. It’s an NHL play, it happens.

“I think I proved to myself in situations that happen like that, which I’m guessing is going to happen again at some point in my career, then I know that I can come back in and do my job.” 
<forge-entity title="Connor McDavid" slug="connor-mcdavid-8478402" code="player">Connor McDavid</forge-entity> and <forge-entity title="Viktor Arvidsson" slug="viktor-arvidsson-8478042" code="player">Viktor Arvidsson</forge-entity> also scored for the Oilers (25-12-3), who have won four straight and seven of nine (7-1-1). <forge-entity title="Brett Kulak" slug="brett-kulak-8476967" code="player">Brett Kulak</forge-entity> had two assists, and <forge-entity title="Leon Draisaitl" slug="leon-draisaitl-8477934" code="player">Leon Draisaitl</forge-entity> had his 14-game point streak (12 goals, 15 assists) come to an end.

“Especially in the first half of the game, I thought we defended really well,” Edmonton coach Kris Knoblauch said. “We did have some breakdowns, and Stu came up with some really big saves. And then in the third period, obviously, they had a strong push and it was a big performance from him.”

<forge-entity title="Jeremy Swayman" slug="jeremy-swayman-8480280" code="player">Jeremy Swayman</forge-entity> made 35 saves for the Bruins (20-18-5), who have lost five in a row (0-4-1) and six of seven (1-5-1).

“They wanted it more, it’s pretty simple,” Boston forward <forge-entity title="Charlie Coyle" slug="charlie-coyle-8475745" code="player">Charlie Coyle</forge-entity> said. “I think it was kind of a lack of urgency, a lot of things that are embarrassing to say right now. They just wanted it more.”

Henrique put the Oilers ahead 1-0 at 6:33 of the first after <forge-entity title="Corey Perry" slug="corey-perry-8470621" code="player">Corey Perry</forge-entity> found him with a pass from behind the net in the slot, where his wrist shot beat Swayman’s glove. 
“I just think we have to find some solutions right now. We showed in Edmonton that we played well enough to beat them there,” Bruins coach Joe Sacco said of their first meeting of the season Dec. 19, which the Oilers won 3-2 in overtime. “We’ve played against some of the top teams in the League and we played well. That was not the case tonight.

“They were certainly playing at a higher level than we were, right from the drop of the puck. They won the majority of races to the pucks, they were quicker than us, they won more 1-on-1 battles. So, we pretty much got what we deserved here tonight.”

McDavid made it 2-0 on the power play at 11:11 of the second, getting sent in on a breakaway by a feed from <forge-entity title="Ryan Nugent-Hopkins" slug="ryan-nugent-hopkins-8476454" code="player">Ryan Nugent-Hopkins</forge-entity> before stickhandling in on Swayman and scoring stick side.

It was the Oilers captain’s first goal in eight games and first point in three. 
“I don’t think we played our style of hockey,” Boston forward <forge-entity title="Trent Frederic" slug="trent-frederic-8479365" code="player">Trent Frederic</forge-entity> said. “The way this team’s built, it’s hard to get into a run-and-gun with a team like that. That’s the game they want to play. We just played right into their hands, and we’re not going to win many games that way, playing like that and not playing our style, not playing the game plan we had lined up for us tonight.”

Henrique’s second goal of the game made it 3-0 at 16:35, this time on a pass from behind the net by <forge-entity title="Jeff Skinner" slug="jeff-skinner-8475784" code="player">Jeff Skinner</forge-entity>. Coyle turned the puck over to <forge-entity title="Zach Hyman" slug="zach-hyman-8475786" code="player">Zach Hyman</forge-entity>, who sent it in behind the net before Henrique got off another quick shot from the top of the right circle.

“A committed, good game from everybody. We were solid throughout, start to finish and top to bottom,” Henrique said. “I was fortunate to get the two goals, but (Nugent-Hopkins and McDavid) made a great play on the power play, Stu taking the hit and then making big saves at key times too. So, there was a lot that went right tonight.”

Arvidsson scored an empty-net goal at 16:25 of the third period for the 4-0 final.

**NOTES:** Skinner and Pickard combined for their second shared shutout and the third overall in Oilers history. They shared a previous one on March 10, 2024, along with <forge-entity title="Grant Fuhr" slug="grant-fuhr-8446991" code="player">Grant Fuhr</forge-entity> and <forge-entity title="Andy Moog" slug="andy-moog-8449681" code="player">Andy Moog</forge-entity> on Jan. 8, 1985. ... Skinner earned a win in his 150th NHL game. His 88 career wins through 150 games are the second most in Edmonton history behind Moog (92). The only other Oilers goalie with at least 80 wins through as many games was Fuhr (85). … Nugent-Hopkins extended his point streak to four games (three goals, one assist).

**Detroit Red Wings 3 - 2 Ottawa Senators**  
The Detroit Red Wings secured their fifth consecutive victory with a 3-2 overtime win against the Ottawa Senators at Little Caesars Arena, thanks to Patrick Kane’s power-play goal. The game was notable for its intense overtime, beginning when Moritz Seider drew a hooking penalty 11 seconds in. Dylan Larkin winning the face-off led directly to Kane’s decisive wrist shot past Anton Forsberg. Larkin extended his personal goal streak to four games and his point streak to six games, while the Red Wings have been rejuvenated since Todd McLellan replaced Derek Lalonde as coach. Despite the loss, Ottawa completed a challenging franchise-record nine-game road trip with a 4-4-1 record. Their captain, Brady Tkachuk, praised the team's resilience during this demanding period. Noteworthy performances included Alex Lyon’s goaltending before his injury and Cam Talbot’s 21 saves in relief. Forsberg’s 30 saves were pivotal, with one spectacular play denying Marco Kasper a goal in the third period. Kane’s impact is undeniable, having notched eight points during Detroit’s streak, continuing his strong career performance against Ottawa.

**New York Rangers 4 - 5 Dallas Stars**  
In a thrilling game at Madison Square Garden, Jamie Benn scored a power-play goal in overtime to lead the Dallas Stars to a 5-4 victory over the New York Rangers, marking their fifth consecutive win. The Stars, who dramatically rallied from a 3-0 first-period deficit, saw goals from Matt Duchene, Evgenii Dadonov, Jason Robertson, and Thomas Harley, with Harley notching a key assist in overtime. Jake Oettinger made 21 saves and secured his 20th win in just 30 games this season, setting a franchise record for the fastest to hit 20 wins. Despite a strong start from the Rangers, with Vincent Trocheck and Alexis Lafreniere each scoring twice and Artemi Panarin contributing three assists, New York couldn’t maintain their lead, with defensive turnovers proving costly. For the Rangers, Jonathan Quick’s bid for a milestone 400th career win was thwarted despite his 34 saves. The game also saw standout moments from Panarin, who matched a franchise record for the most three-point periods by a Ranger, tying with Rod Gilbert. Injuries saw Stars' Ilya Lyubushkin and Rangers' Filip Chytil leave the game early, with no further updates on their conditions.

**Philadelphia Flyers 2 - 3 Toronto Maple Leafs**  
Matthew Knies scored the decisive goal in the third period as the Toronto Maple Leafs secured a 3-2 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers, marking their fifth consecutive win. Auston Matthews, who had his 200th multipoint game—the fastest by any U.S.-born NHL player—won a crucial face-off that set up Knies' goal.

Despite a determined final push and pulling Fedotov late, the Flyers couldn't capitalize on their chances, including an almost open-net attempt by Owen Tippett. Toronto's win was underscored by solid performances from Matthews on both offensive and defensive fronts, reinforcing his role as a cornerstone of the team following his return from injury.

**Minnesota Wild 6 - 4 St Louis Blues**  
The Minnesota Wild staged a thrilling comeback to defeat the St. Louis Blues 6-4, marking their fourth consecutive victory. Jake Middleton had an impressive performance with a goal and an assist following his first game back from an injury. The Wild, who trailed 4-2 after allowing St. Louis to score four consecutive goals, rallied with four unanswered goals, including a crucial game-tying score by Middleton in the third period. Marc-Andre Fleury excelled in relief, stopping all 15 shots he faced, while Marcus Johansson sealed the win with an empty-net goal. St. Louis, despite taking a 4-2 lead early in the second period thanks to Robert Thomas, fell short due to their lack of grit compared to Minnesota’s resolute play. This victory was notable as the Wild's fourth multigoal comeback win of the season, tying them with several teams for second most in the NHL.
