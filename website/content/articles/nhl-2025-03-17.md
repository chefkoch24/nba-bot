**Detroit Red Wings 3 - 0 Vegas Golden Knights**  
Mrazek makes 18 saves, Red Wings shut out Golden Knights 
 **DETROIT --** <forge-entity title="Petr Mrazek" slug="petr-mrazek-8475852" code="player">Petr Mrazek</forge-entity> made 18 saves for the Detroit Red Wings in a 3-0 win against the Vegas Golden Knights at Little Caesars Arena on Sunday. 
It was Mrazek’s 14th career shutout for the Red Wings, but first since Jan. 22, 2018. He was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers later that season and was acquired by Detroit from the Chicago Blackhawks prior to the NHL Trade Deadline on March 7.

“Playing three straight games has definitely helped,” Mrazek said. “I hadn’t played for a while, and once you are playing, you get your confidence and your swagger back.” 
<forge-entity title="Lucas Raymond" slug="lucas-raymond-8482078" code="player">Lucas Raymond</forge-entity> scored his first goal in 11 games for the Red Wings (32-29-6), who had lost seven of eight.

“At the end of the night, the scoreboard was a really good thing for our team,” Detroit coach Todd McLellan said. “It was a good night for a lot of our players, which should give us some confidence.”

<forge-entity title="Ilya Samsonov" slug="ilya-samsonov-8478492" code="player">Ilya Samsonov</forge-entity> made 24 saves for the Golden Knights (39-20-8), who did not have a power play and lost for the fourth time in five games (1-2-2), including 4-3 in a shootout at the Buffalo Sabres on Saturday.

“We were a tired hockey team and they knew we were a tired hockey team,” Vegas coach Bruce Cassidy said. “That’s why I was salty about not putting yesterday’s game away.”

<forge-entity title="Albert Johansson" slug="albert-johansson-8481607" code="player">Albert Johansson</forge-entity> gave the Red Wings a 1-0 lead at 7:58 of the second period, taking a pass from <forge-entity title="Vladimir Tarasenko" slug="vladimir-tarasenko-8475765" code="player">Vladimir Tarasenko</forge-entity> and deking Samsonov before sliding the puck into the open net.

Moments before the goal, <forge-entity title="Jonatan Berggren" slug="jonatan-berggren-8481013" code="player">Jonatan Berggren</forge-entity> kept the play alive by keeping the puck on the edge of the blue line.

“It was tight -- really tight,” said Cassidy, who decided against challenging the call on the ice. “I think we stopped playing a little bit, thinking it was offside. That’s a millimeter that could have kept the game scoreless.” 
<forge-entity title="Ivan Barbashev" slug="ivan-barbashev-8477964" code="player">Ivan Barbashev</forge-entity> had a breakaway 1:45 into the third period but shot wide.

“We needed to do something to get us going, and we got the breakaway,” Cassidy said. “If we get that quick strike to tie it, it deflates the other team a little bit.”

Raymond then made it 2-0 at 4:51, cutting between two defenders, kicking the puck onto his stick and beating Samsonov for his 23rd goal and first since Feb. 22.

Vegas nearly scored midway through the third when <forge-entity title="Mark Stone" slug="mark-stone-8475913" code="player">Mark Stone</forge-entity>’s shot trickled past Mrazek, but <forge-entity title="Dylan Larkin" slug="dylan-larkin-8477946" code="player">Dylan Larkin</forge-entity> cleared the puck away from the crease.

<forge-entity title="Marco Kasper" slug="marco-kasper-8483464" code="player">Marco Kasper</forge-entity> scored at 11:14, redirecting <forge-entity title="Erik Gustafsson" slug="erik-gustafsson-8476979" code="player">Erik Gustafsson</forge-entity>’s feed into an open net for the 3-0 final.

The Golden Knights were held to five shots on goal in the third.

“They are a really good team, and we know that,” Kasper said. “We just tried to play a tight-checking game and tried to get some volume shooting.”

**NOTES:** Mrazek’s span of 2,611 days between shutouts for Detroit is the fifth-longest in NHL history by a goalie for the same franchise behind Pete Peeters (3,312 days with the Philadelphia Flyers), Bill Ranford (3,280 with the Boston Bruins), Brian Boucher (3,064 with Philadelphia) and Roberto Luongo (2,950 with the Florida Panthers). … Red Wings forward Patrick Kane had an assist in his 1,287th NHL game, which moved him past Phil Kessel for 10th all-time among United States-born players. … Jack Eichel’s eight-game point streak and Pavel Dorofeyev’s run of three games with a goal each came to an end.

**Colorado Avalanche 4 - 3 Dallas Stars**  
In a thrilling NHL matchup, Cale Makar secured a win for the Colorado Avalanche against the Dallas Stars by scoring just 34 seconds into overtime, following the Avalanche's recovery from a blown two-goal lead in the third period to win 4-3. Makar, who also tallied two assists, navigated through the offensive zone and delivered a decisive wrist shot to beat Dallas goalie Jake Oettinger.

Jonathan Drouin and Valeri Nichushkin each contributed a goal and an assist to the Avalanche's victory, while Martin Necas scored, helping Colorado extend their winning streak to eight of their last nine games. On the other side, Jason Robertson, Mavrik Bourque, and Matt Duchene scored for the Stars, who have been struggling with recent losses. Notably, Makar's performance placed him third among active defensemen for career three-point games, and Nathan MacKinnon extended his home point streak to 21 games, joining elite company in the NHL with such a record.

**St Louis Blues 7 - 2 Anaheim Ducks**  
The St. Louis Blues delivered a commanding 7-2 victory over the Anaheim Ducks at Enterprise Center, led by strong performances from Dylan Holloway and Jake Neighbours, each contributing a goal and an assist. Jordan Kyrou also shone, notching three assists, as St. Louis won their ninth game out of the last 13 by capitalizing on Anaheim's defensive lapses, which included Luka Dostal allowing five goals on 14 shots before being replaced. The game, delayed due to travel issues, saw Brayden Schenn score just 41 seconds in, marking the start of a night celebrating his 1,000th NHL game. Despite a brief comeback effort by the Ducks, the Blues quickly reasserted control, with notable power-play success under the stewardship of assistant coach Steve Ott. St. Louis has now limited opponents to under 30 shots for the 13th straight game while maintaining an impressive head-to-head streak, winning seven out of their last ten games against Anaheim since December 2021.

**New York Rangers 1 - 3 Edmonton Oilers**  
In a compelling matchup at Madison Square Garden, the Edmonton Oilers emerged victorious over the New York Rangers with a 3-1 win, highlighted by Leon Draisaitl extending his impressive point streak to 18 games with an assist on Corey Perry's first-period goal. Draisaitl's streak, featuring 27 points, places him among elite company as the fourth-longest streak by a non-North American player in NHL history. Viktor Arvidsson and Connor McDavid also contributed goals for the Oilers, with McDavid extending his own point streak to 11 games and securing his 25th goal of the season. Stuart Skinner's timely saves and Ryan Nugent-Hopkins' three assists were crucial, especially against the backdrop of the Rangers' faltering power play, now 1-for-20 in recent games. Despite a spirited performance by the Rangers, including a goal by Will Cuylle with assistance from Artemi Panarin, who continued his streak to nine games, the Oilers’ defensive efforts, particularly Jake Walman’s six blocked shots, helped them seal the win. This victory marked a strong conclusion to Edmonton's four-game road trip.

Ilya Sorokin made 22 saves, including a crucial stop in the final minute, preserving the lead. The Panthers, who had taken a 2-0 lead with goals from Aleksander Barkov and Sam Reinhart, admitted to faltering defensively in the final period, a point of concern for head coach Paul Maurice and the team.

**Vancouver Canucks 1 - 3 Utah Hockey Club**  
Logan Cooley ended his seven-game point drought by scoring the go-ahead goal early in the third period, leading the Utah Hockey Club to a 3-1 victory over the Vancouver Canucks at Rogers Arena. Cooley's goal came after a deflection by Sean Durzi of a Nick Schmaltz point shot, which hit off Canucks forward Teddy Blueger's skate before Cooley fired it into the net past Kevin Lankinen. This win was crucial for Utah as it moved them closer to a playoff spot in the Western Conference. Karel Vejmelka was solid in goal with 18 saves, and Utah effectively killed off three power plays, including a critical four-minute penalty. Clayton Keller sealed the victory with an empty-net goal.

**Seattle Kraken 2 - 3 Winnipeg Jets**  
Dylan Samberg scored 1:47 into overtime to secure the Winnipeg Jets' third consecutive win with a 3-2 triumph over the Seattle Kraken at Climate Pledge Arena. Samberg capitalized on a cross-crease pass from Cole Perfetti, who also notched a goal and an assist. The game featured notable goaltender movements for Winnipeg, as starter Eric Comrie was temporarily replaced by Connor Hellebuyck after a collision, but returned to play after Hellebuyck conceded a goal. Despite early goals from Seattle's Jani Nyman and Michael Eyssimont, the Jets responded with Perfetti's crucial goal before the end of the first period and Kyle Connor's tying goal in the second. For Seattle, Nyman's goal marked his second in just three NHL games, highlighting his impressive start. Winnipeg's win marked their eighth in overtime this season, tying them with Pittsburgh and Ottawa for the second-most in the league, behind Edmonton.
