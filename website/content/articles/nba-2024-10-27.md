**Denver Nuggets 104 - 109 LA Clippers**  
The Los Angeles Clippers secured a narrow 109-104 victory over the Denver Nuggets, overcoming a stellar 41-point performance by Nikola Jokic, who made a career-high seven 3-pointers but missed a crucial free throw in the game's closing moments.

Highlighting the night was a sportsmanship gesture where Colorado's star Nathan MacKinnon honored Jokic by presenting him with the Michael Jordan Trophy prior to the game. The Nuggets, struggling from beyond the arc recently, improved during the game but faltered in the decisive moments. As the Clippers prepare to face Golden State, the Nuggets head for a three-game road trip beginning in Toronto.

In a decisive victory, the Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Washington Wizards 135-116, with Donovan Mitchell scoring 30 points and Jarrett Allen delivering a flawless 10-for-10 shooting performance for 23 points. The Cavaliers, maintaining their perfect start over three games this season, shot an impressive 54% from the floor, marking their ninth consecutive win against the Wizards and following a victory against Detroit. Darius Garland contributed 23 points, while Evan Mobley added a double-double with 13 points and 13 rebounds. For the Wizards, Bilal Coulibaly achieved a career-high 23 points, but they faced their second home loss of the season on the heels of a disappointing previous season.

In a strong season-opening performance, the Minnesota Timberwolves secured a 112-101 victory over the Toronto Raptors in Minneapolis, with Julius Randle playing a pivotal role by contributing 24 points, nine rebounds, and five assists. Anthony Edwards matched Randle's scoring with 24 points, while Rudy Gobert added a double-double with 15 points, 13 rebounds, and four blocks. The Raptors, hindered by the absence of RJ Barrett and a sluggish start that saw them miss eight of their first nine shots, were led by Gradey Dick's game-high 25 points. Despite a third-quarter effort that cut the deficit to single digits, the Raptors couldn't overcome Minnesota's lead. Notably, the Timberwolves attracted a robust fanbase, selling 11,000 season tickets for the first time since entering the Target Center in 1990, and showcased new additions Randle and Donte DiVincenzo, who collectively impressed the home crowd.

**Los Angeles Lakers 131 - 127 Sacramento Kings**  
The Los Angeles Lakers improved to a 3-0 record, marking their best start since the 2010-11 season, after an impressive comeback victory against the Phoenix Suns, erasing a 22-point first-half deficit to win 123-116. Anthony Davis led the team with 35 points, joining Lakers legends Jerry West and Elgin Baylor in scoring 35-plus points in each of the season's first two games. Davis, along with LeBron James and Austin Reaves, played crucial roles in the triumph, benefiting from first-year head coach JJ Redick’s strategy focusing on Davis. The Lakers now face the Sacramento Kings, who swept Los Angeles in all four meetings last season. The Kings, coming off a narrow 117-115 loss to Minnesota, saw significant performances from new addition DeMar DeRozan and Domantas Sabonis, despite De'Aaron Fox's subdued scoring night. Sacramento's high-volume 3-point shooting, with Keegan Murray's strong performance offsetting DeRozan's mid-range reliance, showcased their evolving dynamic in the season opener.
