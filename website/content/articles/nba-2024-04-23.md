**New York Knicks 104 - 101 Philadelphia 76ers**  
Donte DiVincenzo made a go-ahead 3-pointer with 13 seconds remaining to cap a stunning rally where the Knicks overcame a five-point deficit in the final 30 seconds to beat the 76ers 104-101 and take a 2-0 series lead. Jalen Brunson struggled shooting but finished with 24 points, while Maxey had a brilliant 35-point performance despite being ill earlier in the day. This was just the fourth time in the play-by-play era that a team won a playoff game after trailing by at least five points in the last 30 seconds, and now the 76ers will look to regroup for Game 3 in Philadelphia.

**Cleveland Cavaliers 96 - 86 Orlando Magic**  
Donovan Mitchell scored 23 points, Jarrett Allen had 20 rebounds, and the Cavaliers defeated the Orlando Magic 96-86 to take a 2-0 series lead. This marks Cleveland's first playoff series lead since 2018 after redeeming themselves from last year's early exit. Allen's impressive performance included nine offensive rebounds, and he joined a select group of Cavs players to grab 20 rebounds in a playoff game. Jalen Suggs suffered a sprained knee but returned to play, inspiring a Magic rally before Mitchell's quick baskets sealed the victory for the Cavs. Game 3 is expected to be another physical battle, with Orlando looking to bounce back on their home court.

**Denver Nuggets 101 - 99 Los Angeles Lakers**  
The Lakers will attempt to slow down Nikola Jokic in Game 2 after losing to the Nuggets in Game 1 despite strong performances from LeBron James and Anthony Davis. Denver has won nine straight games against Los Angeles, largely due to Jokic's dominance with 32 points, 12 rebounds, and seven assists in Game 1. The Lakers struggled to contain Jokic, with various defenders unable to stop him. Los Angeles coach Darvin Ham plans to make adjustments for the rest of the series. The Nuggets are looking to start faster and shoot more efficiently in Game 2, with Jamal Murray aiming to improve on his 9-for-24 shooting performance. Despite a strong showing from James and Davis, the Lakers need more contribution from their bench players. The Nuggets have been successful in containing the Lakers' role players in recent playoff matchups. This sets the stage for a competitive Game 2, with both teams aiming to make necessary adjustments for success.
