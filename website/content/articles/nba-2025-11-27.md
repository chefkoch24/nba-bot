**Boston Celtics 117 - 114 Detroit Pistons**  
The Boston Celtics halted the Detroit Pistons' impressive 13-game winning streak, tying a franchise record, by edging out a 117-114 victory. Despite Cade Cunningham's stellar 42-point performance, the Eastern Conference-leading Pistons couldn't break the record they share with past championship teams, standing at 15-3 just two seasons after losing 28 consecutive games. Jaylen Brown led the Celtics with 33 points and 10 rebounds, while Derrick White contributed significantly by scoring 11 of his 27 points in the final minutes. A crucial last-minute call saw Cunningham fouled near mid-court during a 3-point attempt, but he managed only two of the three free throws. Payton Pritchard secured the rebound and sealed the game with two free throws, adding to his 16-point contribution. The Celtics have now won five of their last six games, while the Pistons look to bounce back as they host Orlando on Friday.

**Charlotte Hornets 101 - 129 New York Knicks**  
In a dominant performance, Jalen Brunson scored 33 points to lead the New York Knicks to a decisive 129-101 victory over the Charlotte Hornets in Charlotte, handing the Hornets their seventh consecutive loss. The Knicks, with a sharp shooting display that included 13 of 26 from three-point range, improved to 3-1 in NBA Cup group play. Karl-Anthony Towns contributed a double-double with 19 points and 10 rebounds, while Josh Hart added 22 points for New York, which is keen to advance in the NBA Cup midseason tournament. Despite Charlotte's Brandon Miller scoring 18 points in his return from a shoulder injury, the Hornets were eliminated from this year's competition, marking their tenth consecutive Cup game loss over the past three seasons. LaMelo Ball struggled for the Hornets, managing only 11 points and earning a technical foul, while Brunson sparked "MVP" chants from the crowd at Spectrum Center. Both teams will soon face new challenges with New York hosting the Bucks and Charlotte hosting the Bulls in their next Cup group games.

**Miami Heat 106 - 103 Milwaukee Bucks**  
Tyler Herro led the Miami Heat with 29 points in a close 106-103 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks in an NBA Cup game, marking the 800th career win for Heat coach Erik Spoelstra. This milestone places Spoelstra as only the third coach to reach 800 wins with a single franchise, joining Gregg Popovich and Jerry Sloan. Bam Adebayo contributed a double-double with 17 points and 11 rebounds as Miami improved their impressive home record to 9-1 for the season. Despite strong performances from Ryan Rollins, who scored 26, and Myles Turner with 24 points, the Bucks continued their struggles, losing their sixth consecutive game without star player Giannis Antetokounmpo, who is expected to return soon. The defeat marked the Bucks' first NBA Cup group stage loss, ending their unbeaten run in these games, and leaves their path in this year's tournament uncertain. Meanwhile, the Heat's path to the quarterfinals depends on the outcome of a Friday matchup between Milwaukee and New York.

**Toronto Raptors 97 - 95 Indiana Pacers**  
The Toronto Raptors secured their ninth consecutive victory with a thrilling 97-95 win over the Indiana Pacers, thanks to Brandon Ingram's decisive 15-foot jumper with just 0.6 seconds remaining. This win not only cemented Toronto's top-two seed status but also guaranteed them homecourt advantage in the NBA Cup quarterfinals, aided by Milwaukee's loss to Miami. Ingram contributed significantly with 26 points and eight rebounds, while Scottie Barnes added a double-double with 24 points and 10 rebounds. The Raptors completed the Cup group stage undefeated at 4-0, boosting their overall record to 14-5.

**Oklahoma City Thunder 113 - 105 Minnesota Timberwolves**  
The Oklahoma City Thunder secured their 10th consecutive win with a 113-105 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves in an NBA Cup Game, driven by an impressive 40-point performance from Shai Gilgeous-Alexander despite his illness. Gilgeous-Alexander, who was questionable before the game, made 12 of 19 field goals and an impressive 15 of 17 free throws, marking his 91st consecutive game scoring at least 20 points, the third-longest streak in NBA history. The Thunder, now 18-1 this season, became just the fifth team in NBA history to achieve such a start and improved to 4-0 in West Group A, positioning themselves well for the knockout round. Anthony Edwards led Minnesota with 31 points and eight rebounds, keeping the Timberwolves in the contest but unable to prevent a third straight loss. Minnesota struggled from the free-throw line, converting just 22 of 37 attempts. This game was a rematch of last season's Western Conference finals, where the Thunder defeated the Timberwolves decisively. The game also saw the return of Kenrich Williams, who made his season debut following a knee injury. The Thunder maintained a lead from the first quarter, and despite Minnesota's third-quarter rally, they managed to secure the win with key plays in the final minute.

**New Orleans Pelicans 128 - 133 Memphis Grizzlies**  
The Memphis Grizzlies edged out the New Orleans Pelicans 133-128 in an overtime thriller during NBA Cup play, thanks to standout performances by Jaren Jackson Jr. with 27 points and Jaylen Wells with 25. Memphis notably outscored the Pelicans by 39 points while rookie Zach Edey, who finished with 21 points and 15 rebounds, was on the court.

The Pelicans saw Jose Alvarado score 24 points, including six 3-pointers, tying the game in overtime before Memphis pulled ahead. Zion Williamson added 17 points for the Pelicans, who couldn't capitalize on three final possessions.

**Golden State Warriors 100 - 104 Houston Rockets**  
In an NBA Cup clash, the Houston Rockets face the Golden State Warriors in San Francisco, with both teams eager to overcome their low ranking in West Group C after 1-2 starts. The Rockets, who previously lost a decisive Game 7 to the Warriors in last year's playoffs, will play without several key players including Kevin Durant, Fred VanVleet, and Al Horford. Draymond Green's participation is uncertain due to an injury. In their last games, Houston decisively defeated the Phoenix Suns with Amen Thompson scoring 28 points, while Golden State triumphed over the Utah Jazz with Stephen Curry's 31-point contribution. Buddy Hield excelled in the Warriors' win, rebounding from a shooting slump by scoring 20 points against the Jazz. Hield's performance offered hope for improvement despite the team's recent struggles. With the absence of notable players like Durant being felt, the Rockets will rely on players like Thompson to continue driving their offensive and defensive efforts.

**Portland Trail Blazers 102 - 115 San Antonio Spurs**  
In a crucial NBA Cup matchup, the Portland Trail Blazers are set to face the San Antonio Spurs, aiming to advance from the competitive West Group C, dubbed "The Group of Death." Portland, standing at 2-1, holds a chance to control their fate following a decisive 115-103 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks, where Jerami Grant delivered a standout performance with a season-high 35 points. The Spurs, struggling without key players Victor Wembanyama and Stephon Castle, are 1-1 after a recent 111-102 loss to the Phoenix Suns, where turnovers led to their downfall. De'Aaron Fox displayed consistent scoring prowess for San Antonio, yet the Trail Blazers' cohesive team play and defensive strength, especially against the Bucks, place them in a prime position to advance with a victory against San Antonio. This game is vital not just for the Cup but also for general standings, with both teams eager to capitalize on the opportunity.

**Sacramento Kings 100 - 112 Phoenix Suns**  
The Sacramento Kings, led by veteran DeMar DeRozan, are set to host the Phoenix Suns in an NBA Cup group match as they aim to extend their two-game winning streak. DeRozan made headlines recently by moving up to 24th on the NBA's all-time scoring list during a thrilling overtime win against Minnesota. Despite the absence of star Domantas Sabonis due to injury, the Kings have been bolstered by the return of Keegan Murray, who impressed with 26 points in the victory over Minnesota. The Phoenix Suns, despite a strong start to the season, had a setback in their previous game against Houston, where they struggled offensively with a season-low 92 points and numerous turnovers. However, the Suns remain a surprise in the NBA, with Devin Booker leading the team with 26.4 points per game and strong contributions from Dillon Brooks and Grayson Allen. Currently, the Suns are second in steals per game and have a notable three-point shooting percentage, positioning them favorably in the NBA Cup West Group A standings.
