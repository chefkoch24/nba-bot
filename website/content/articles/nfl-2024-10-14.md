**Denver Broncos 16 - 23 Los Angeles Chargers**  
In a match defined by injuries and strategic plays, the Los Angeles Chargers secured a 23-16 victory over the Denver Broncos, largely influenced by the early exit of Broncos' defensive ace Patrick Surtain II due to a concussion. This key absence allowed Chargers' quarterback Justin Herbert to execute a precise, time-consuming offensive strategy, leading to a comfortable lead and marking Herbert's season highs in completions and yards. Despite a late-game surge from the Broncos, including two touchdowns spearheaded by quarterback Bo Nix, they fell short, unable to compensate for their early deficit or capitalize on turnovers. Chargers head coach Jim Harbaugh, who briefly exited the game due to an irregular heartbeat, praised Herbert's performance while emphasizing the importance of their methodical offense. The Chargers' victory was their first over Denver in two years and broke their losing streak against Sean Payton, highlighting the impact of Surtain’s absence on the Broncos' defense.

Justin Fields, while throwing for just 145 yards, added 59 rushing yards and two touchdowns, securing his starting position amidst past performance doubts and the reactivation of Russell Wilson. The Steelers' defense rebounded by allowing only 275 yards, a significant improvement following recent struggles, with T.J. Watt forcing two fumbles. Despite a strong opening drive, Raiders' quarterback Aidan O'Connell faltered, throwing a key interception that led to a Steelers touchdown. The Raiders played without key offensive weapons, adding to their woes as penalties and turnovers quashed any comeback attempts.

Despite the win, Eagles' coach Nick Sirianni drew attention by confronting fans who had been chanting for his dismissal, highlighting ongoing dissatisfaction from the Philadelphia faithful. The Eagles’ victory was aided by the return of key receivers A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith, both recovering from injuries. The Browns struggled offensively, securing their only touchdown through a blocked field goal return by Rodney McLeod Jr. Quarterback Deshaun Watson faced criticism for his performance, as the Browns failed to muster an offensive touchdown and continue to underwhelm this season.

Kicker Evan McPherson rebounded from a missed crucial kick last week to make a go-ahead 37-yard field goal in the third quarter. The Bengals' defense, previously underperforming, shone this game, highlighted by Trey Hendrickson's two sacks and Germaine Pratt's interception of Daniel Jones. Despite a promising 16-play, 79-yard drive by the Giants culminating in a 1-yard touchdown run by rookie Tyrone Tracy, the Giants struggled to capitalize on opportunities, missing two field goals and failing to convert critical downs, as they now stand winless at home. The Giants were also hampered by key absences, including rookie receiver Malik Nabers.

In a commanding 35-16 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars in London, the Chicago Bears showcased a stellar performance with Caleb Williams throwing four touchdown passes, two of which were caught by tight end Cole Kmet. Kmet not only excelled offensively but also unexpectedly stepped in as long snapper after an injury to Scott Daly, performing impeccably despite minimal practice in that role. Keenan Allen added to the offensive fireworks with two touchdown receptions, leading a memorable celebration with his teammates. The Bears' defense capitalized on mistakes, turning a fumble into points, while Jacksonville struggled with dropped passes and penalties, prompting head coach Doug Pederson to address the team’s "self-inflicted wounds."

His game-winning throw came late in the fourth quarter when he found Michael Pittman Jr., who was playing through injury, for a 10-yard TD. The Colts' defense played a pivotal role, stifling the Titans in the final quarter and forcing key turnovers.

The Titans struggled with penalties, accumulating 113 yards, and questions loom over their 1-4 record under first-year coach Brian Callahan. Meanwhile, Flacco improved his record with the Colts to 1-1, highlighting the importance of readiness in the face of injuries to starting QB Anthony Richardson.
