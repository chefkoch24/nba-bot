Jackson delivered an impressive performance with 323 passing yards and an additional 40 rushing yards, while Derrick Henry powered through with 132 rushing yards and two touchdowns, maintaining his league-leading status with nine touchdowns.

**Denver Broncos 16 - 23 Los Angeles Chargers**  
Justin Herbert led the Los Angeles Chargers to a 23-16 victory over the Denver Broncos, capitalizing on the early exit of Denver's key defender, Patrick Surtain II, due to a concussion. The Chargers built a commanding 23-0 lead by the third quarter, leveraging a methodical offense that saw Herbert set season highs in completions and yards. The Broncos, missing Surtain, struggled defensively, and their late-game rally fell short as Bo Nix directed two fourth-quarter touchdowns. Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh, who briefly exited due to an illness but returned to the sidelines, praised Herbert’s precision and poise. Denver's attempts, including an unsuccessful onside kick, were insufficient to overcome their early deficit and end their three-game winning streak. The win marked the Chargers' first triumph over Denver in two years and highlighted Surtain's critical role in the Broncos' defense.

This marked Harris's first 100-yard game of the season, helping Pittsburgh snap a two-game losing streak and achieve their highest-scoring game since December. Quarterback Justin Fields contributed 59 rushing yards and two touchdowns, despite throwing for only 145 yards, amidst speculation about his starting status due to Russell Wilson's return. T.J. Watt was instrumental in the defensive effort, forcing two fumbles and making impactful plays despite not recording any sacks. The Raiders' offense struggled without key players Davante Adams, Jakobi Meyers, and Zamir White, while rookie quarterback Aidan O'Connell's fourth-quarter interception proved costly. The Steelers capitalized on mistakes, including a roughing-the-passer penalty and a blocked punt, to seal their victory.

The victory was soured by injuries to key players like Dallas Goedert and Darius Slay, while the Browns struggled with their own setbacks, including a disappointing performance from quarterback Deshaun Watson, who failed to produce an offensive touchdown. Cleveland's sole touchdown came from Rodney McLeod Jr. returning a blocked field goal, and their season-long offensive woes continued as they remained winless in scoring 20 points in a game.

**Dallas Cowboys 9 - 47 Detroit Lions**  
In a dominant performance, Jared Goff led the Detroit Lions to a resounding 47-9 victory over the Dallas Cowboys, throwing for 315 yards and three touchdowns. This result exacerbated the Cowboys' struggles at home, marking their fourth consecutive lopsided loss at AT&T Stadium and their worst home defeat since 1988. Despite Goff's impressive display, which included a completion streak that nearly set an NFL record, the win was dampened by a serious injury to key pass rusher Aidan Hutchinson, who will require surgery. Dallas' defense, weakened by injuries to key players like Micah Parsons, could not contain the Lions, who scored over 40 points in consecutive games for the first time since 1962. The Cowboys' offensive woes continued with Dak Prescott throwing two interceptions and contributing to five total turnovers. Detroit's victory was further sweetened by some playful redemption against the officials over a disputed call from a previous meeting. The struggling Cowboys now face a weekend off to regroup, while the Lions prepare to face the undefeated Minnesota Vikings.

Quarterback Kirk Cousins had a subdued role this week, contrasting with his record-breaking 509-yard performance the previous week against the Buccaneers, throwing for 225 yards and a touchdown. The Falcons capitalized on Carolina's defensive struggles, as the Panthers have now allowed a league-high 203 points over six games. Despite scoring touchdowns via Andy Dalton's passes, the Panthers saw their momentum undone by costly turnovers and penalties. Falcons coach Raheem Morris emphasized adaptability, highlighting their strategic shift from a dominant passing game last week to a formidable rushing attack against the Panthers. Carolina struggled with errors and injuries, and Dalton's two interceptions in the fourth quarter solidified the Falcons' victory.

Despite facing a struggling Giants team, the Bengals' defense, ranked 31st in the league, excelled with key contributions, including two sacks from Trey Hendrickson and a pivotal interception by Germaine Pratt. Chase Brown provided a game-clinching 30-yard touchdown run, while Evan McPherson rebounded from a prior missed kick to score a go-ahead 37-yard field goal.

**Chicago Bears 35 - 16 Jacksonville Jaguars**  
In an unusual and eventful game in London, the Chicago Bears defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars 35-16, with Bears tight end Cole Kmet unexpectedly stepping in as an emergency long snapper after Scott Daly's knee injury. Kmet, who had only limited practice in this role since high school, handled the snaps flawlessly and also caught two touchdown passes from rookie quarterback Caleb Williams. Williams, who was the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft, threw four touchdowns and added 56 yards rushing in a strong performance. Keenan Allen also contributed with two touchdown catches, including a memorable celebration after one of his scores. The Jaguars struggled with “self-inflicted wounds,” as noted by head coach Doug Pederson, including a costly fumble by tight end Evan Engram. Despite some strong efforts from Trevor Lawrence, who threw two late touchdowns, Jacksonville could not overcome their mistakes. The Bears achieved their first three-game winning streak since 2020, while the Jaguars remained in a slump, having only won one game so far this season.

The Titans, despite a promising start with a touchdown run by Tony Pollard, suffered their third consecutive one-score loss, plagued by seven interceptions by quarterback Will Levis this season and multiple penalties totaling 113 yards. The Colts' defense, despite missing key players, held strong in the fourth quarter, limiting the Titans' possession and clinching the win. The game also highlighted the ongoing struggles of wide receiver Calvin Ridley, who was held without a catch and expressed frustration over the lack of early involvement in games. The Colts now turn their focus to hosting Miami, while the Titans prepare for a road game against Buffalo.
