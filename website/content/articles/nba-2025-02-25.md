Injuries continued to plague the 76ers, with Joel Embiid out for a knee examination, Guerschon Yabusele exiting with a facial injury, and Quentin Grimes dealing with knee soreness.

**Washington Wizards 107 - 99 Brooklyn Nets**  
The Washington Wizards ended their six-game losing streak with a 107-99 win over the Brooklyn Nets, highlighted by Jordan Poole's 26 points, including key shots during a decisive 7-0 run late in the game. Bilal Coulibaly contributed 20 points for the Wizards, who achieved their 10th victory of the season and held an opponent under 100 points for the first time this year.

The Nets missed key players like D'Angelo Russell and Noah Clowney due to ankle injuries, while the Wizards were without Malcolm Brogdon and Alex Sarr for the same reason. This loss was a blow to Brooklyn's play-in aspirations as they are 1.5 games behind the Chicago Bulls for the final spot.

**Atlanta Hawks 98 - 86 Miami Heat**  
The Atlanta Hawks secured a 98-86 victory over the Miami Heat, breaking their three-game losing streak, with Trae Young contributing 11 points and 14 assists. Onyeka Okongwu led the team with 17 points and eight rebounds, while Terrance Mann and Caris LaVert each chipped in 15 points off the bench. Notably, NBA steals leader Dyson Daniel recorded seven steals, close to his season high. The Hawks allowed their fewest points since a March 2021 win against Cleveland, moving past Miami for eighth in the Eastern Conference. Miami's Andrew Wiggins scored 23 points, despite the team's struggle from beyond the arc, missing 13 of their first 14 attempts. All-Star Tyler Herro, usually a strong performer, was held to just 11 points. The Heat, now grappling with a 2-6 record following Jimmy Butler's trade on Feb. 5, continue to search for an effective rotation under Coach Erik Spoelstra. Hawks coach Quin Snyder expressed satisfaction with his team's performance, which saw them restrict Miami to a season-low 32.1% shooting. The teams are set to face off again on Wednesday in Miami.

**Oklahoma City Thunder 128 - 131 Minnesota Timberwolves**  
In a remarkable comeback, the Minnesota Timberwolves overturned a 25-point deficit in the second half to defeat the Oklahoma City Thunder 131-128 in overtime. Jaden McDaniels led the Timberwolves with 27 points, while Anthony Edwards contributed significantly by blocking Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's crucial shot in the final moments of overtime. Despite Gilgeous-Alexander's impressive 39-point performance, the Thunder couldn't capitalize, with missed opportunities including a missed 3-pointer with 2.9 seconds left. The Thunder initially dominated, leading 82-57 in the third quarter and 102-80 by the fourth. Yet, a spectacular fourth-quarter effort, spearheaded by reserve Terrence Shannon's 11 points, allowed the Timberwolves to outscore the Thunder 41-19. Notably, Minnesota's rally was achieved largely without Edwards, who only played briefly in the fourth quarter, and without center Rudy Gobert, who was out with back spasms. The Timberwolves made history as the first NBA team to win a road game after trailing by 20 or more points entering the fourth quarter against a team with an .800 or better winning percentage.

Despite Utah's 18 successful three-pointers and 41% shooting from beyond the arc, they struggled at the rim and committed costly turnovers, leading to their sixth loss in eight games. The Trail Blazers broke a three-game road losing streak as they embark on a seven-game trip.

**Sacramento Kings 130 - 88 Charlotte Hornets**  
In an upcoming game between the Charlotte Hornets and the Sacramento Kings, both teams are seeking to boost their offensive stats amidst recent defensive struggles. Charlotte has faced significant challenges, suffering a 53-point loss to Portland, tying the franchise's worst defeat, after a surprising win against the Lakers. Meanwhile, Sacramento has also been struggling defensively, conceding an average of 136 points per game in their last two outings. LaMelo Ball, known for his impressive performances in Sacramento, is expected to be a key player as he plays in his home state once more. Looking to avoid a three-game losing streak and improve from a turnover-heavy recent game against the Warriors, Kings coach Doug Christie emphasizes reducing turnovers as crucial for a rebound victory. Both teams will meet for the first time this season, anticipating a rematch in April.
