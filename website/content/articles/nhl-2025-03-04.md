**Montreal Canadiens 4 - 3 Buffalo Sabres**  
The Montreal Canadiens clinched their fifth consecutive win, defeating the Buffalo Sabres 4-3 in overtime at Bell Centre. Mike Matheson scored the game-winner just 1:21 into extra time, securing Montreal's longest win streak since 2022. Despite blowing an initial 3-0 lead, with goals from Nick Suzuki, Cole Caufield, and Juraj Slafkovsky, the Canadiens maintained momentum through strong special teams play, scoring twice on the power play. Suzuki excelled with a shorthanded goal and three assists, continuing his impressive performance leading to his NHL Third Star of the Week honor. On the Sabres' side, Alex Tuch extended his goal streak to four games, but the team's struggles on special teams, highlighted by key penalties from Rasmus Dahlin, contributed to their third straight loss. Notably, Lane Hutson became the fastest Canadiens defenseman to reach 50 NHL points, achieving the milestone in his 63rd game.

The Rangers also defeated the Nashville Predators 4-0 on Sunday behind 34 saves from <forge-entity title="Jonathan Quick" slug="jonathan-quick-8471734" code="player">Jonathan Quick</forge-entity>. It's the seventh time in team history they've recorded shutout wins on consecutive days.

"It feels like we're playing a better brand of hockey, more consistent 60 minutes aside from that third period against Nashville," Rangers forward <forge-entity title="Will Cuylle" slug="will-cuylle-8482157" code="player">Will Cuylle</forge-entity> said. "Two shutouts in a row speaks for itself. I think we're all making a pretty strong commitment to defense and obviously defense wins hockey games so we're going to keep trying to do that."

Cuylle, <forge-entity title="J.T. Miller" slug="j-t-miller-8476468" code="player">J.T. Miller</forge-entity> and <forge-entity title="Artemi Panarin" slug="artemi-panarin-8478550" code="player">Artemi Panarin</forge-entity> each had a goal and an assist. <forge-entity title="Will Borgen" slug="will-borgen-8478840" code="player">Will Borgen</forge-entity> scored his first career short-handed goal. Shesterkin got his fourth shutout of the season. 
The Rangers (31-26-4) have won four of five games. They are tied with the Detroit Red Wings for the second wild card into the Stanley Cup Playoffs from the Eastern Conference. They each have 66 points.

"We give ourselves a chance to win," Rangers forward <forge-entity title="Mika Zibanejad" slug="mika-zibanejad-8476459" code="player">Mika Zibanejad</forge-entity> said. "I don't think we shoot ourselves in the foot in the same way we've maybe done it before. … We're playing simple. I don't feel like we're panicking as much. If they have momentum, alright let's try to break it. Bend don't break. It doesn't hurt to have two elite goalies back there too."

<forge-entity title="Ilya Sorokin" slug="ilya-sorokin-8478009" code="player">Ilya Sorokin</forge-entity> made 22 saves for the Islanders (27-26-7), who had won their previous two games.

They are five points out of a playoff spot and play the NHL-leading Winnipeg Jets at UBS Arena on Tuesday.

"You never like coming into the room after a game like this and not putting anything on the board and losing a big hockey game," Islanders forward <forge-entity title="Anders Lee" slug="anders-lee-8475314" code="player">Anders Lee</forge-entity> said. "So, it sits with you for sure. I mean, there's always a level of something that doesn't feel right. How do you individually and as a group come back together and continue to play the best that you can? That's what tomorrow night will bring."

Cuylle scored his goal off his head from in front of the net to give the Rangers a 1-0 lead at 15:03 of the first period.

"A real beauty," Rangers coach Peter Laviolette said, smiling. "One he'll remember probably for the rest of his life." 
<forge-entity title="Kyle Palmieri" slug="kyle-palmieri-8475151" code="player">Kyle Palmieri</forge-entity> blocked <forge-entity title="Zac Jones" slug="zac-jones-8481708" code="player">Zac Jones</forge-entity>' shot from the point. The puck popped up in the air, hit Cuylle on the right side of his head and went into the net.

"I was just trying to get to the net, get in the goalie's eyes and I think it just got blocked," Cuylle said. "I saw it coming so I just had to get my face out of the way and whatever happens happens."

The Rangers went up 2-0 on Borgen's short-handed goal at 19:15. Cuylle took a hit from <forge-entity title="Noah Dobson" slug="noah-dobson-8480865" code="player">Noah Dobson</forge-entity> high in the Rangers' defensive zone but still made the play to push the puck up the ice and out of the zone to <forge-entity title="Sam Carrick" slug="sam-carrick-8475842" code="player">Sam Carrick</forge-entity>.

"I didn't think he was going to hit me because it was short-handed," Cuylle said. "I thought he was going to pull out. Obviously, nice read by Sam there."

Carrick carried the puck into the left face-off circle before leaving it back for Borgen, who scored with a bar-down wrist shot into the short side.

"You love to see him jump up in a play like that and he has the skill," Laviolette said. "That was a great shot and a big goal at the time."

Miller made it 3-0 at 3:43 of the third period with a blocker-side wrist shot from the right circle. The play was a result of <forge-entity title="Tony DeAngelo" slug="tony-deangelo-8477950" code="player">Tony DeAngelo</forge-entity>'s neutral zone turnover. It was Miller's fifth goal in as many games.

"The third goal was not a pretty one, but we didn't generate," Islanders coach Patrick Roy said. "I thought both teams didn't generate much offense all night long. We didn't play the type of hockey that I was expecting."

Panarin scored into the empty net with 5:09 remaining in the third period to give the Rangers a 4-0 lead.

"I thought we were really good," Laviolette said. "'Shesty', he was good, he made big saves when he needed to, but I thought we were good in front of him. Guys were heavy in front of him. Blocked shots, heavy on sticks, eliminated second opportunities. When it got scrambly right in the slot area I thought our guys cracked down hard and defended well."

**NOTES:** The Islanders had a would-be goal from Lee at 8:24 of the first taken away because of a successful coach's challenge from the Rangers for offside. Video replay showed <forge-entity title="Casey Cizikas" slug="casey-cizikas-8475231" code="player">Casey Cizikas</forge-entity> preceded the puck into the zone 10 seconds before Lee scored. … Islanders center <forge-entity title="Brock Nelson" slug="brock-nelson-8475754" code="player">Brock Nelson</forge-entity> played in his 900th game, all with the Islanders. He's the fifth player to play in at least 900 games with the Islanders joining <forge-entity title="Bryan Trottier" slug="bryan-trottier-8451965" code="player">Bryan Trottier</forge-entity> (1,123), <forge-entity title="Denis Potvin" slug="denis-potvin-8450505" code="player">Denis Potvin</forge-entity> (1,060), <forge-entity title="Josh Bailey" slug="josh-bailey-8474573" code="player">Josh Bailey</forge-entity> (1,057) and Bobby Nystrom (900). ... Miller's two points extended his point streak to six games (five goals, five assists).
