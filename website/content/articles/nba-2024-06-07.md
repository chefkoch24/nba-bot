**Boston Celtics 107 - 89 Dallas Mavericks**  
In Game 1 of the NBA Finals, the Boston Celtics decisively defeated the Dallas Mavericks 107-89, fueled by Jaylen Brown's 22 points and the impactful return of Kristaps Porzingis, who contributed 20 points off the bench after a month-long injury hiatus. Porzingis energized the home crowd and added six rebounds and three blocks in 21 minutes, affirming his confidence post-injury. The Celtics led by 29 points in the first half, hitting 16 three-pointers, and fended off a Dallas comeback attempt with a 14-0 run in the third quarter. Jayson Tatum posted a double-double with 16 points and 11 rebounds. Luka Doncic led Dallas with 30 points, but the Mavericks struggled offensively, tallying only nine assists and failing to score 25 points in any quarter. Former Celtic Kyrie Irving was met with boos and finished with 12 points. Boston, eyeing their first championship since 2008, maintained momentum from their sweep of the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference finals.
