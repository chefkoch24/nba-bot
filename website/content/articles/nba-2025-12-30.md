Antetokounmpo tallied 29 points, capping his performance with a memorable last-second windmill dunk that sparked a skirmish between the teams, illustrating the Bucks' urgency as they try to improve their standings in the Eastern Conference.

Despite Banchero's late-game effort, including a missed step-back 3-pointer at the buzzer, the Magic couldn't secure back-to-back victories for the first time in nearly a month. Notably, Mo Bamba made his debut for Toronto but didn't score, and center Jakob Poeltl was absent due to a back injury, with his return date uncertain. The Magic will face Indiana next, while the Raptors are set to host Denver on Wednesday.

**Chicago Bulls 101 - 136 Minnesota Timberwolves**  
In a dominant display, the Minnesota Timberwolves, led by Naz Reid's season-high 33 points off the bench and Anthony Edwards' 23 points, cruised to a 136-101 victory over the Chicago Bulls, who were hindered by injuries to key scorers Coby White and Josh Giddey. Julius Randle contributed 17 points as the Timberwolves surged in the third quarter during the first game of their four-game trip. Despite Nikola Vucevic's 23-point effort for Chicago, the Timberwolves capitalized on the Bulls' misfortunes, including 16 turnovers, to extend their lead comfortably. Key to Minnesota's success was their 53.7% shooting accuracy and limiting their turnovers to just three. Chicago, previously on a good run bringing them back to .500, struggled after losing White early in the game to a calf strain and Giddey to a hamstring injury shortly after halftime. Notably, veteran Mike Conley marked his 1,200th game in the NBA, while the Bulls faced additional concerns with Zach Collins expected to miss more time due to a sprained toe. Minnesota's decisive third quarter, outscoring Chicago 40-28, proved pivotal as they shook off an early nine-point deficit to take command.
