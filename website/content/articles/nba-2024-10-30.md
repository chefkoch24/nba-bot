**Brooklyn Nets 139 - 144 Denver Nuggets**  
Nikola Jokic delivered a historic performance with 29 points, 18 rebounds, and 16 assists, becoming just the second NBA player ever, after Hall of Famer Oscar Robertson, to achieve those stats in a game. His efforts helped the Denver Nuggets secure a 144-139 overtime victory against the Brooklyn Nets. Jamal Murray and Aaron Gordon added 24 points each for Denver, with Russell Westbrook contributing 22. Despite Brooklyn's strong start, leading by 17 in the second quarter and setting a season high with 72 first-half points, they couldn't maintain their momentum. Cam Thomas scored 26 and Nic Claxton added a double-double with 16 points and 12 rebounds for the Nets. A missed opportunity at the foul line by Dorian Finney-Smith allowed Jokic's inside basket to tie the game, pushing it to overtime where the Nuggets dominated. The win marked Denverâ€™s fourth consecutive victory over Brooklyn, with Jokic securing two triple-doubles in the Nuggets' first four games of the season.

**Minnesota Timberwolves 114 - 120 Dallas Mavericks**  
In an intense rematch of last season's Western Conference finals, the Dallas Mavericks secured a 120-114 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves, fueled by Kyrie Irving's impressive 35-point performance, including 16 in the third quarter. Luka Doncic contributed with a late-game surge, finishing with 24 points, nine assists, and eight rebounds, despite struggling with his shooting, particularly from three-point range. Anthony Edwards had a record-setting first quarter at Target Center, scoring 24 of his 37 points, while his overall performance was hindered by turnovers, as Minnesota committed 20, leading to 25 Dallas points. Both teams showed moments of promise and vulnerability, with Irving's defensive prowess adding a crucial edge for Dallas, who played on consecutive nights after a victory against Utah. Edwards continued his impressive start to the season with his four-game streak of scoring five or more three-pointers, the longest in team history. The Mavericks look ahead to hosting Houston, and the Timberwolves prepare to face Denver.

**Utah Jazz 96 - 113 Sacramento Kings**  
In a dominating performance, the Sacramento Kings defeated the struggling Utah Jazz 113-96 in Salt Lake City, with Domantas Sabonis leading the charge with 28 points and 11 rebounds, and De'Aaron Fox contributing 19 points. The Jazz, who have started the season with four consecutive losses, struggled defensively, particularly without Taylor Hendricks, who suffered a season-ending injury, and Lauri Markkanen, who exited due to back spasms. Despite shooting only 25.8% from beyond the arc, the Kings excelled with 65.6% shooting inside, taking advantage of midrange opportunities. DeMar DeRozan, in his strong start with the Kings, scored 20 points, marking his fourth consecutive game with at least 20 points, a feat only surpassed in franchise history by Chris Webber and Oscar Robertson. The Jazz, missing key players and relying heavily on younger talent, succumbed to the Kings' third-quarter surge led by Fox, who fueled a 29-14 run. Looking ahead, the Kings are set to face Atlanta, while the Jazz will take on San Antonio.

**Golden State Warriors 124 - 106 New Orleans Pelicans**  
In a thrilling comeback, the Golden State Warriors overcame a 20-point deficit to defeat the New Orleans Pelicans 124-106, largely driven by Buddy Hield, who scored a season-best 28 points. Brandin Podziemski contributed significantly with 19 points and crucial plays in the second half, helping the Warriors recover from a poor start where they shot only 5-for-23 in the first quarter. Despite the absence of key players Stephen Curry, Andrew Wiggins, and De'Anthony Melton due to injuries, the Warriors capitalized on New Orleans' 24 turnovers, scoring 34 points from those mistakes. Zion Williamson shone for the Pelicans with a season-high 31 points, while Brandon Ingram added 30. Jonathan Kuminga and Lindy Waters III stepped up off the bench for the Warriors, scoring 17 and 21 points respectively. Coach Steve Kerr managed to guide the team despite being short-handed, with Hield returning to form by nailing seven 3-pointers after a tough previous game.
