The Milwaukee Bucks showcased their depth with a commanding 111-107 victory over the depleted New Orleans Pelicans, using a dominant fourth quarter to secure their fourth consecutive win and solidify fifth place in the Eastern Conference.

In a late-season NBA matchup, the Portland Trail Blazers secured a 120-109 victory over the San Antonio Spurs, driven by Toumani Camara's impressive 23 points and 11 rebounds. Despite both teams being eliminated from play-in contention due to Sacramento's victory over Cleveland, Portland showed determination as they ended a three-year playoff drought pursuit.

Chris Paul's late-game push brought the Spurs within striking distance, but a crucial 3-pointer and consistent play by Portland helped maintain their lead.

The Suns, led by Devin Booker's 40-point effort, struggled without Kevin Durant and dropped their sixth straight game. Karl-Anthony Towns contributed 19 points and 13 rebounds, while Mikal Bridges added 22 points against his former team, highlighting an exciting clash.

**Denver Nuggets 120 - 125 Indiana Pacers**  
The Indiana Pacers triumphed over the Denver Nuggets 125-120, despite being without Pascal Siakam and overcoming a 13-point first-half deficit. Obi Toppin emerged as a key player, scoring 22 points in just his second start of the season, while Myles Turner led the team with 24 points. The Nuggets, struggling with their fourth consecutive loss, saw a remarkable performance from Nikola Jokić, who recorded 41 points, 15 rebounds, and 13 assists, complemented by Christian Braun's career-high 30 points. A crucial backcourt turnover in the final seconds, involving a miscommunication between Jokić and Braun, diminished Denver’s chances of a comeback. Tyrese Haliburton struggled initially, held scoreless until late in the third quarter, but rebounded to help the Pacers take control. Denver, once in second place in the Western Conference, now risks facing a play-in game to enter the playoffs, beset by key player absences like Jamal Murray with a strained hamstring.
