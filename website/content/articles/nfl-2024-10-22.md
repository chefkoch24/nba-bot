**Tampa Bay Buccaneers 31 - 41 Baltimore Ravens**  
In a thrilling Monday night showdown, Lamar Jackson led the Baltimore Ravens to a 41-31 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, solidifying their fifth consecutive win. Jackson, showcasing some of the finest performances of his career, threw for 281 yards and five touchdowns, while improving his record against NFC teams to an impressive 23-1. Despite the Buccaneers taking an early 10-0 lead with Mike Evans' 100th career TD catch, they struggled after Evans suffered a hamstring injury, and their receiver corps was further depleted when Chris Godwin was carted off with a severe ankle injury late in the game. Ravens' cornerback Marlon Humphrey played a pivotal role by intercepting two passes in the second quarter, fueling Baltimore's comeback. The Ravens also added 243 rushing yards, becoming the fourth team since 1980 to amass over 1,400 rushing yards in the first seven games of a season. The Buccaneers continued to fight, scoring twice in the closing minutes, but ultimately fell short in their first home game since Hurricane Milton forced them to temporarily relocate.

**Arizona Cardinals 17 - 15 Los Angeles Chargers**  
In an exciting Monday night matchup, Kyler Murray led the Arizona Cardinals to a narrow 17-15 victory over the Los Angeles Chargers. Murray's notable performance included a dynamic 44-yard touchdown run, marking his 20th career game with both a passing and rushing touchdown. He later orchestrated a game-winning drive, setting up Chad Ryland's 32-yard field goal as time expired. The Chargers relied heavily on kicker Cameron Dicker, who tied a franchise record with a 59-yard field goal among his five total kicks, but struggled to find the end zone despite amassing 395 yards. The game saw early turnover drama as Arizona's defense recovered fumbles after two promising Los Angeles plays. Both teams grappled with key injuries, with the Chargers missing Joey Bosa and the Cardinals seeing Sean Murphy-Bunting and Dennis Gardeck exit due to injuries. Arizona improved to 3-4, while the Chargers fell to 3-3.
