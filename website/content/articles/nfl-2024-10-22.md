**Tampa Bay Buccaneers 31 - 41 Baltimore Ravens**  
Lamar Jackson led the Baltimore Ravens to a 41-31 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, throwing for 281 yards and five touchdowns, marking one of the best performances of his career. The Ravens overcame an early 10-0 deficit against a Buccaneers team that struggled with injuries, notably losing top receivers Mike Evans and Chris Godwin during the game. Jackson's impressive play, including a historic 23-1 record against NFC teams, helped extend Baltimore's winning streak to five games, scoring on seven of nine possessions. On the ground, Derrick Henry contributed significantly with 169 rushing yards and a touchdown catch. Despite a late-game push by Tampa Bay, including a successful onside kick, the injuries and Baltimore's strong offense, highlighted by Marlon Humphrey's two crucial interceptions, were too much to overcome. The Ravens also continued their dominant rushing streak, becoming one of four teams since 1980 to amass at least 1,400 rushing yards in the first seven games of a season.

**Arizona Cardinals 17 - 15 Los Angeles Chargers**  
In an exciting Monday night matchup, Kyler Murray led the Arizona Cardinals to a narrow 17-15 victory over the Los Angeles Chargers. Murray's 44-yard rushing touchdown early in the fourth quarter and a subsequent drive, capitalized by Chad Ryland's 32-yard game-winning field goal with no time left, sealed the Cardinals' win. This dramatic finish was made possible by a critical unnecessary roughness penalty on the Chargers' Cam Hart and a powerful 33-yard run from James Conner, who amassed 101 rushing yards. Despite the Chargers' offense managing 395 yards, they struggled to convert, with Justin Herbert throwing for 349 yards without a touchdown. Cameron Dicker's impressive five field goals, including a franchise-record-tying 59-yarder, couldn't secure a win for Los Angeles. Meanwhile, mishaps, including costly early fumbles and injuries to key players like Joey Bosa and Hayden Hurst, further hampered the Chargers' efforts.
