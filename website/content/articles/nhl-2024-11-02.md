The New York Islanders snapped a three-game losing streak with a 4-3 victory over the Buffalo Sabres at KeyBank Center. Bo Horvat and Maxim Tsyplakov each tallied a goal and an assist for the Islanders, while Ilya Sorokin made 32 saves.

Coach Patrick Roy praised the team's resilience, particularly as they managed with just four defensemen following injuries. For the Sabres, Jason Zucker stood out with a goal and an assist, but the team was undone by defensive lapses. Dylan Cozens opened the scoring with his first goal of the season.

**New York Rangers 2 - 1 Ottawa Senators**  
In a thrilling matchup at Madison Square Garden, Igor Shesterkin's standout performance with 40 saves propelled the New York Rangers to a 2-1 victory over the Ottawa Senators. This marked Shesterkin's second consecutive game with at least 40 saves, reminiscent of his rookie-year streak in 2020. The Rangers took an early lead with Artemi Panarin's goal, assisted by Alexis Lafreniere, who later scored the game-winning goal on a power play. Despite being outshot 41-18, the Rangers capitalized on key moments and displayed resilience, while Ottawa, unable to capitalize on power plays, struggled against Shesterkin's extraordinary goaltending. This game emphasized Shesterkin's importance, lifting his save percentage to .931, and highlighted Lafreniere's growing impact, marking his second multipoint game of the season.

**Columbus Blue Jackets 2 - 6 Winnipeg Jets**  
Nikolaj Ehlers shone brightly for the Winnipeg Jets, scoring a hat trick and adding an assist in their 6-2 victory over the Columbus Blue Jackets. This performance, which marked Ehlers' fifth career hat trick and his first since 2018, was instrumental in maintaining the Jets' impressive form, pushing their record to 10-1-0 and making them one of only 12 teams in NHL history to secure 10 wins in their first 11 games. Winnipeg's success is largely credited to their defensive discipline, as highlighted by goalie Eric Comrie's comments, allowing them to outscore opponents 52-26 and remain unbeaten on the road with a 6-0-0 record. The Blue Jackets, despite ending their four-game point streak and boasting Monahan's 250th NHL career goal, struggled against the Jets' speed and defensive pressure, compounded by their own mistakes. Dmitri Voronkov made his season debut for Columbus, returning from injury, while Ehlers and teammates like Gabriel Vilardi and Mason Appleton contributed to a balanced attack that outmaneuvered Columbus defenders for crucial goals.

Filip Gustavsson's 28 saves helped secure the victory. For Tampa Bay, Brayden Point, Jake Guentzel, and Nick Paul scored, but their three-game winning streak was snapped.

**Calgary Flames 3 - 0 New Jersey Devils**  
Vladar makes 22 saves, Flames shut out Devils
 **CALGARY --** <forge-entity title="Dan Vladar" slug="dan-vladar-8478435" code="player">Dan Vladar</forge-entity> made 22 saves for the Calgary Flames in a 3-0 win against the New Jersey Devils at Scotiabank Saddledome on Friday. 
The shutout was Vladar's third in the NHL and his first since Nov. 21, 2021.

"First of all, it's a huge win for us after a couple losses in a row. I want to point that out," Vladar said. "This is a nice day for me, especially against \[<forge-entity title="Jacob Markstrom" slug="jacob-markstrom-8474593" code="player">Jacob Markstrom</forge-entity>\]. The most important thing is two points after a stretch we couldn't grab a win."

<forge-entity title="Blake Coleman" slug="blake-coleman-8476399" code="player">Blake Coleman</forge-entity> had two goals, and <forge-entity title="Jonathan Huberdeau" slug="jonathan-huberdeau-8476456" code="player">Jonathan Huberdeau</forge-entity> also scored for the Flames (6-4-1), who ended a four-game losing streak during which they were outscored 19-6.

"I felt that we deserved to win," Coleman said. "Our effort was much better all around tonight. I thought we checked tight, didn't give up a whole lot, and when we did 'Vladdy' was great. That's the way we've got to play. We know that and we know we got away from it for a couple of games. It's a tough brand of hockey, but when we're on, that's what we look like." 
Markstrom made 29 saves for the Devils (7-5-2), who had won two in a row. He was playing his first game against the Flames since being traded to New Jersey on June 19.

"It's a special place for sure and the fans here are great," Markstrom said. "Tough one for us. It was back and forth until five minutes left in the game, and 'Colesy' got a 'Colesy' goal, nice tip, and then they scored to make it 2-0. We've got to recharge the battery here and come back ready in a few days."

Coleman gave the Flames a 1-0 lead at 14:26 of the third period, redirecting <forge-entity title="Kevin Bahl" slug="kevin-bahl-8480860" code="player">Kevin Bahl</forge-entity>'s shot from the left point five-hole on Markstrom.

Huberdeau scored 28 seconds later to make it 2-0, tapping in a return pass from <forge-entity title="Anthony Mantha" slug="anthony-mantha-8477511" code="player">Anthony Mantha</forge-entity> on a 2-on-1.

"You've just got to believe our guys are going to score," Vladar said. "I never had a doubt the whole game. I knew we were going to bury at least one. I was just focusing on the next one. They did an awesome job in front of me today. I didn't have to make any second saves" 
Coleman scored into an empty net from just above his own goal line with 3:15 remaining for the 3-0 final. The goal came shortly after Vladar made a left pad save on <forge-entity title="Jesper Bratt" slug="jesper-bratt-8479407" code="player">Jesper Bratt</forge-entity> with Markstrom on the bench for the extra attacker.

"I don't know if we ever really found our legs," New Jersey coach Sheldon Keefe said. "It was clear from the first period we didn't have our legs, we didn't have our hands here today. It was one of those games where we were going to have to play really good defensively to hang around, which I thought we did. I don't think we gave up very much at all until the very end.

"You've just got to hope you can find your game, get a little bit of pace to it, get one to go in and take control of the game. We weren't able to do that. We cracked at the end, and they had an opportunity to score two. That's the game."

**NOTES:** Bahl was acquired by Calgary along with a first-round pick in the 2025 NHL Draft in the Markstrom trade. ... Devils captain <forge-entity title="Nico Hischier" slug="nico-hischier-8480002" code="player">Nico Hischier</forge-entity> had his four-game goal streak end (five goals). ...
