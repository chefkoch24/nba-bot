**Boston Celtics 120 - 89 Orlando Magic**  
In Game 5 of their first-round playoff series, the Boston Celtics advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals by defeating the Orlando Magic 120-89. Jayson Tatum led the Celtics with an impressive performance, scoring 35 points, contributing 10 assists, and grabbing eight rebounds. Despite setting a regular-season NBA record for 3-point baskets, the Celtics did not make a single 3-pointer in the first half, a first for them in nearly four years, but found success through other strategies. The turning point came when Orlando's Paolo Banchero, who scored 19 points, picked up his fifth foul early in the third quarter, sidelining him for the remainder of the quarter and allowing Boston to break away with a 31-9 run. Orlando coach Jamahl Mosley was visibly frustrated, believing the Banchero foul call was crucial. Meanwhile, Franz Wagner managed 25 points for Orlando. The Celtics now await their next opponent, either the New York Knicks or the Detroit Pistons, as they aim to defend their championship title.

**New York Knicks 103 - 106 Detroit Pistons**  
The Detroit Pistons, powered by Cade Cunningham's 24 points, eight rebounds, and eight assists, forced a Game 6 in their first-round series against the New York Knicks by securing a 106-103 victory in Game 5. This marks their first postseason appearance since 2019, and they've managed to pivot from a 14-win team to a playoff contender with a 44-38 record. The Pistons showcased resilience, with Ausar Thompson scoring 22 points and Tobias Harris adding 17, demonstrating a strong team bond and fighting spirit as highlighted by Harris. Despite an NBA record-tying nine consecutive home playoff losses since 2008, Detroit appears comfortable playing in New York, securing two regular-season wins and now two postseason victories there, including a key win that ended their 15-game postseason losing streak, the longest in NBA history. Meanwhile, the Knicks, led by OG Anunoby's 19 points and Karl-Anthony Towns' 17, struggled with Jalen Brunson having an uncharacteristic game, scoring just 16 points on 4-for-16 shooting. The Knicks lost pivotal momentum when Brunson and Josh Hart briefly exited with injuries in the closing minutes. Now, both teams will face off in Detroit for Game 6, with the Knicks aiming to clinch the series after falling short of extending their playoff success at home.

**Indiana Pacers 119 - 118 Milwaukee Bucks**  
In an electrifying game, the Indiana Pacers advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals with a dramatic 119-118 overtime victory over the Milwaukee Bucks, wrapping up the series 4-1. Tyrese Haliburton emerged as the hero, overcoming earlier fourth-quarter struggles to succeed in critical moments, including a decisive go-ahead layup with 1.3 seconds left. Haliburton finished with 26 points and 10 assists, maintaining his perfect 9-0 home playoff record. The Bucks, hampered by the absence of Damian Lillard due to injury, struggled despite Giannis Antetokounmpo's impressive triple-double performance and Gary Trent Jr.'s prowess and crucial mistakes in overtime. The heated game concluded with a scuffle instigated by Haliburton's father, adding tension to the fierce rivalry. The Pacers will next face top-seeded Cleveland, with Game 1 set for Sunday.

**Denver Nuggets 131 - 115 LA Clippers**  
In a high-stakes Western Conference quarterfinal, the Denver Nuggets secured a crucial win against the Los Angeles Clippers, taking a 3-2 lead in the series. Aaron Gordon made NBA playoff history with the first-ever walk-off dunk, evening the series at 2-2 prior to this victory, and reigniting Denver's hopes after two tough losses. Historically, winning Game 5 in a tied 2-2 series often leads to clinching the series, but Denver has previously suffered heartbreaks in such instances. The game was intense, with near altercations and six technical fouls issued; Michael Porter Jr. narrowly avoided suspension. The Clippers' Kawhi Leonard is performing strongly, averaging 26.5 points per game, and the team has effectively rotated its bench. Despite missing Russell Westbrook due to a foot injury, Denver has relied heavily on its starters, with Nikola Jokic leading the team in points, rebounds, and assists. Interim coach David Adelman emphasized this strategy, underscoring the importance of his starting lineup's court time to secure victories.
