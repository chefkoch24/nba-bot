**Detroit Red Wings 4 - 5 Vancouver Canucks**  
In an exciting clash at Little Caesars Arena, Jake DeBrusk's third goal in overtime sealed a 5-4 victory for the Vancouver Canucks over the Detroit Red Wings. DeBrusk's hat trick marked his second career instance, with the first occurring during his time with the Boston Bruins. Kevin Lankinen made history as the first NHL goaltender to win his first 10 road games in a season, surpassing records held by Glenn Hall and Cam Talbot. Elias Pettersson's three assists set up pivotal plays, while Quinn Hughes, assisting thrice, became the Canucks' all-time leading defenseman in assists. Vancouver capitalized on power plays, with DeBrusk scoring twice during a crucial 5-on-3 advantage. Despite goals from Michael Rasmussen and Vladimir Tarasenko giving Detroit a brief lead, Erik Brannstrom's late goal sent the game to overtime. The Red Wings suffered setbacks with Talbot's injury and a loss of momentum, while notable performances from Jonatan Berggren and Alex DeBrincat couldn't secure a win.
