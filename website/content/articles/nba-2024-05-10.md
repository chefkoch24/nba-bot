**Oklahoma City Thunder 110 - 119 Dallas Mavericks**  
In Game 2 between the Thunder and Mavericks, Luka Doncic struggled against Lu Dort's defense as Oklahoma City took a 1-0 series lead with a 117-95 victory. Doncic, shooting poorly from beyond the arc in the playoffs, aims to bounce back despite battling a knee injury. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder with 29 points, while the team's aggressive defense and ball movement resulted in a franchise-high 29 assists. Mavericks coach Jason Kidd looks to make adjustments to free up Doncic for Game 2, as Dort continues to be a defensive force for the Thunder.
