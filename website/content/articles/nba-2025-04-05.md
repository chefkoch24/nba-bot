**Charlotte Hornets 102 - 125 Sacramento Kings**  
In an impressive road victory, the Sacramento Kings defeated the Charlotte Hornets 125-102, with Domantas Sabonis playing a pivotal role by contributing 24 points, 11 rebounds, and seven assists, nearly achieving a triple-double before leaving the game in the third quarter with a minor injury scare. This win was critical for the Kings as it helped them maintain their 10th place standing in the Western Conference and keep a narrow half-game lead over the Phoenix Suns for a play-in tournament spot. Zach LaVine added to the Kings' victory with 25 points and 10 rebounds, while DeMar DeRozan chipped in 22 points. Despite the Hornets' injury struggles, with players like LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller out for the season, and remaining starter Miles Bridges leading with 22 points, the Kings dominated, building a 19-point halftime lead and keeping Charlotte's starters to a meager 5-of-24 from the 3-point line. The Kings continue their campaign against the Cavaliers, while the Hornets face the Bulls on Sunday.

**Indiana Pacers 140 - 112 Utah Jazz**  
The Indiana Pacers secured their third consecutive victory by defeating the Utah Jazz 140-112, tightening their hold on fourth place. Myles Turner led with 26 points, seven rebounds, and an impressive six blocked shots, four of which came during a pivotal third quarter. Pascal Siakam and Bennedict Mathurin contributed 22 and 20 points, respectively, with Siakam matching a season-best four blocks. Indiana tallied a season-high 17 blocks, just two shy of the franchise record set in 1979. Despite Utah's strong first half led by Collin Sexton and Johnny Juzang, and their 10 three-pointers and 11 offensive rebounds, they were unable to maintain their momentum and succumbed to Indiana’s potent second-half scoring burst. The Pacers overcame a slow start and a shaky showing at the free-throw line by shooting a scorching 67.4% from the field, scoring 83 points in the second half, and clinching a promising position for home-court advantage in the upcoming playoffs.

**Boston Celtics 123 - 103 Phoenix Suns**  
In a commanding 123-103 victory over the Phoenix Suns, the Boston Celtics set a new NBA record for most 3-pointers in a season, achieving a total of 1,370 and surpassing the previous record of 1,363 set by the Golden State Warriors in the 2022-23 season. Jaylen Brown spearheaded the Celtics with 31 points, including three 3-pointers. Jayson Tatum contributed significantly with 23 points, eight rebounds, and eight assists. Kristaps Porzingis scored 15 before leaving due to a nose injury caused by an accidental elbow from Cody Martin, later returning to the bench. The Suns struggled despite Devin Booker's 37 points, marking their fifth consecutive loss. Boston maintained a comfortable lead, never allowing it to fall below double digits in the second half. The Celtics now look forward to hosting the Wizards, while the Suns aim to rebound against the Knicks. Notably, Bradley Beal's return after a hamstring injury was uneventful, with him shooting 0 for 7, and Kevin Durant remained sidelined due to an ankle injury.

Despite missing key players like Cade Cunningham and Tobias Harris due to injuries, the Pistons showed resilience, marking a significant turnaround from a franchise-worst 14-win season and a 28-game losing streak. Malik Beasley added 21 points, while Isaiah Stewart was notably serving a suspension. This win underscored Detroit's dominance over Toronto, marking their sixth consecutive win against the Raptors, who, despite efforts from Ja'Kobe Walter and others, suffered their 50th loss of the season, a repeat of last year's struggles.

Notably, Josh Giddey achieved his sixth triple-double of the season for the Trail Blazers, contributing 15 points, 19 rebounds, and 12 assists. The Bulls, sitting at 10th in the Eastern Conference, are aiming to improve their postseason position, while Portland, 12th in the West, was hampered by key injuries, missing players like Anfernee Simons and Jerami Grant. Deni Avdija stood out for Portland with 37 points, and despite a recent win in Toronto, the Trail Blazers ended their five-game trip with a 2-3 record. White also tied his own Bulls season record for three-pointers, reinforcing his crucial role in the win by sinking late free throws to secure the victory.

Jalen Green shone with 34 points, while Alperen Sengun added 31, helping the Rockets, who are second in the Western Conference, improve their record against the top-seeded Thunder to 2-3. Despite the Thunder's late rallies, particularly with key plays from Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Jalen Williams, the Rockets managed to maintain their lead, solidifying their win with a strong fourth quarter. Gilgeous-Alexander reached a milestone by scoring at least 20 points for the 70th consecutive game, surpassing Michael Jordan for the fourth-longest single-season streak in NBA history. Oklahoma City's Chet Holmgren also made a franchise impact, hitting a career-high six 3-pointers. The Rockets managed this victory without their key defender Dillon Brooks, who was serving a suspension. Houston dominated the boards, outrebounding Oklahoma City 48-33, and will next face Golden State, while the Thunder are set to face the Lakers.

**San Antonio Spurs 113 - 114 Cleveland Cavaliers**  
The Cleveland Cavaliers narrowly defeated the San Antonio Spurs 114-113, led by Donovan Mitchell's 26 points and Evan Mobley's 25 points and 10 rebounds, bringing them a step closer to clinching the best record in the Eastern Conference. Despite leading by as much as 23 points, the Cavaliers had to withstand a fierce Spurs rally in the final moments, highlighted by Harrison Barnes' 3-pointer that cut the lead to one with 29 seconds remaining. A missed layup by Barnes as time expired sealed Cleveland's victory. San Antonio, struggling after key injuries and Coach Gregg Popovich's mild stroke earlier this season, was led by Devin Vassell's 24 points and Barnes' 23. The Cavaliers' strong shooting, particularly in the first half where they hit 15 of 30 from beyond the arc, contributed significantly to their third consecutive win. Meanwhile, the Spurs continue their challenging season with Chris Paul, aiming to play every game for just the second time in his career, contributing nine points and eight assists.

**Golden State Warriors 118 - 104 Denver Nuggets**  
Stephen Curry dazzled with a 36-point performance as the Golden State Warriors secured a 123-116 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers, setting up an enticing matchup against the Denver Nuggets. The Warriors aim to avoid a season sweep by Denver, who have won their previous two encounters, including a notable game where they triumphed without Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray. Currently holding third place in the Western Conference, the Nuggets lead the Warriors by just 1.5 games, and another loss could draw Golden State level in the loss column, though Denver retains the tie-breaker advantage. The Nuggets' roster situation remains unclear with Murray's lingering hamstring issue, though Aaron Gordon and Jokic are likely to play. Young talents Jalen Pickett and Brandin Podziemski have recently impressed for their respective teams, with Podziemski hitting eight 3-pointers and contributing significantly in the Warriors' recent road win. Despite fatigue from their recent game, Warriors coach Steve Kerr emphasized a team-focused approach, anticipating a full squad for this crucial game against the Nuggets.

**Los Angeles Lakers 124 - 108 New Orleans Pelicans**  
The Los Angeles Lakers are striving to maintain home-court advantage in the playoffs but recently lost 123-116 to the Golden State Warriors, with standout performances from LeBron James and Austin Reaves, who scored 33 and 31 points respectively. Despite making 18 three-pointers, including a career-high nine by Reaves, the Lakers lost for the fifth time in their last eight games. LeBron, recovering from a groin injury, expressed optimism about his improving condition. Upcoming, they face the New Orleans Pelicans, who are near the bottom of the standings and have shut down key players Zion Williamson and CJ McCollum for the season. In their last game, the Pelicans were competitive against the LA Clippers despite a 114-98 loss, with notable contributions from Jose Alvarado and Bruce Brown. Although the Pelicans showed strong field-goal shooting and rebounding, turnovers and poor three-point shooting hampered their efforts. The Lakers, with four of their last six games on the road, must capitalize on this opportunity against the struggling Pelicans.

**LA Clippers 114 - 91 Dallas Mavericks**  
The Dallas Mavericks, led by Anthony Davis' remarkable performance, took on the Los Angeles Clippers in a crucial matchup as they fight for a spot in the NBA play-in tournament. Two months after being traded from the Lakers, Davis returned to Los Angeles and delivered a standout game, posting 34 points, 15 rebounds, and five blocks in a victory over Atlanta. The Mavericks, battling injuries and roster changes, are aiming for a play-in spot amidst a tight race with the Suns and Kings. Meanwhile, the Clippers have surged in form, winning nine of their last 11 games, with Kawhi Leonard and James Harden leading the charge. Currently seventh in the West, the Clippers are within striking distance of the top three, displaying strong defensive cohesion. Both teams are keeping an eye on the standings as they prepare for another encounter at the Intuit Dome, following a December split in Dallas.
