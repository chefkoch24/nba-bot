**Boston Celtics 132 - 109 New York Knicks**  
On opening night, Jayson Tatum led the Boston Celtics to a commanding 132-109 victory over the New York Knicks, scoring 37 points and tying an NBA record with eight of the team's 29 successful 3-pointers. Celebrating their 18th championship banner, the Celtics, who have dominated the Eastern Conference, were relentless, even leading by as much as 35 points before missing their last 13 attempts from beyond the arc. Derrick White contributed 24 points and Jaylen Brown added 23. For the Knicks, Jalen Brunson scored 22 points, while new acquisition Karl-Anthony Towns managed just 12 points and seven rebounds. Despite significant offseason additions, the Knicks struggled to compete with Boston, as evidenced by the TD Garden crowd shifting its attention to chants of "Yankees Suck!" during the blowout. The Celtics, after aiming unsuccessfully to break Milwaukee's 2020 record for 3-pointers, will now face Washington, while the Knicks prepare for their home opener against Indiana.

**Los Angeles Lakers 110 - 103 Minnesota Timberwolves**  
In a historic night for the NBA, the Los Angeles Lakers secured a 110-103 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves with LeBron James and his son, Bronny, making history as the first father and son to play in the NBA at the same time and on the same team. This memorable pairing occurred for nearly two-and-a-half minutes during Bronny's NBA debut. LeBron contributed 16 points to the win, but it was Anthony Davis who stole the spotlight with an outstanding 36 points and 16 rebounds, driving the Lakersâ€™ performance. Rui Hachimura added 18 points, and the game marked a successful coaching debut for JJ Redick, the former NBA player now leading the Lakers. On the Timberwolves' side, Anthony Edwards scored 27 points, but the team struggled after trading Karl-Anthony Towns, with Julius Randle and Donte DiVincenzo making their debuts for Minnesota. Randle managed 16 points and nine rebounds, yet the Timberwolves faced difficulties in adapting to their new lineup. Despite these challenges, LeBron also reached a milestone by matching Vince Carter's record of 22 NBA seasons.
