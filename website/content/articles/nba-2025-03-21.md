**Los Angeles Lakers 89 - 118 Milwaukee Bucks**  
In a dominant performance, the Milwaukee Bucks defeated the depleted Los Angeles Lakers 118-89, with Giannis Antetokounmpo leading the charge by scoring 28 points. The Bucks, who were missing Damian Lillard, took control of the game with a pivotal 20-5 run to close the first quarter. Gary Trent Jr. contributed significantly from the bench with 23 points, hitting 6 of 10 three-pointers, compensating for the team's overall shooting struggles from beyond the arc. Despite Bronny James reaching double figures for the first time in his NBA career with 17 points, the Lakers struggled without key players such as LeBron James, Luka Doncic, and Austin Reaves. The loss snapped the Lakers' nine-game home winning streak. Milwaukee's win helped them regain confidence after losing five of their last seven games, which is crucial for securing a playoff home-court advantage. The Bucks are set to face Sacramento on Saturday, while the Lakers will host Chicago.

**Golden State Warriors 117 - 114 Toronto Raptors**  
In a thrilling game, Jimmy Butler recorded his second triple-double for the Golden State Warriors, tallying 18 points, 11 rebounds, and 12 assists in a narrow 117-114 victory over the Toronto Raptors. The win was bittersweet for the Warriors as Stephen Curry left the game with a pelvic contusion after a hard fall, despite contributing 17 points before his exit. Draymond Green had an impressive first half, scoring 18 of his 21 points early, reminiscent of his performance in the 2016 Finals. The Warriors showcased their depth and resilience, with Quinten Post also adding 18 points on six three-pointers. For the Raptors, Scottie Barnes put up a strong fight with 29 points and 10 rebounds, but the absence of RJ Barrett proved challenging. The win marked the Warriors' 16th victory in 19 games since acquiring Butler, positioning them as strong contenders for the postseason. A crucial defensive play by Butler late in the game, including a block and two successful free throws, secured the win. The Warriors now head to Atlanta, while the Raptors prepare to host the Spurs.

**Charlotte Hornets 115 - 98 New York Knicks**  
In a compelling matchup, the Charlotte Hornets secured a 115-98 victory over the New York Knicks, led by LaMelo Ball's 25 points and eight assists. Five Hornets players, including Ball, reached double figures, with Mark Williams contributing 19 points and 14 rebounds, while Miles Bridges added a double-double with 15 points and 10 rebounds. This win marked Charlotte's first against the Knicks since December 2024, snapping a six-game losing streak and providing a bright spot after a turbulent month of numerous heavy losses. Despite a strong presence of Knicks fans in Charlotte echoing the atmosphere of Madison Square Garden, particularly during a controversial technical foul on Karl-Anthony Towns, the Hornets maintained their dominance. For the Knicks, O.G. Anunoby and Towns were standout performers with 25 and 24 points respectively, but it wasn't enough to halt their recent slump, having dropped six of their last nine games. Charlotte capitalized on their perimeter shooting, converting nearly 47% of their three-point attempts, with Ball and DaQuan Jeffries leading the way. Both teams look ahead to their next games: the Knicks hosting Washington and the Hornets facing Oklahoma City.

**Indiana Pacers 105 - 99 Brooklyn Nets**

The Nets' struggles continued, marking their 12th loss in 14 games, as the team scored just 39 points in the second half.

The win marks Indianaâ€™s fifth victory in six games, achieved without their star point guard, Tyrese Haliburton, who missed his third consecutive game due to a back issue. Mathurin's three clutch free throws with 14 seconds left in regulation were pivotal in sending the game to overtime. The two teams will face off again in Indianapolis on Saturday.

**Sacramento Kings 116 - 128 Chicago Bulls**  
Coby White delivered an outstanding performance, scoring 35 points to lead the Chicago Bulls to a 128-116 victory over the Sacramento Kings. The Bulls, who were down 64-55 at halftime, turned the game around with a thrilling 11-0 run in the third quarter, thanks in part to White's impressive 31 points in the second half. Nikola Vucevic contributed significantly by shooting 9 for 14, including 4 for 5 from three-point range, finishing with 24 points. Despite Malik Monk's strong showing with 34 points for the Kings, Sacramento struggled defensively, allowing the Bulls to shoot 52.3% from the field. Kevin Huerter also stood out for Chicago, scoring 25 points, his highest total since December 8. Taking advantage of the absence of Sacramento's Domantas Sabonis due to a sprained ankle, the Bulls secured the win, shifting their focus to their upcoming game against the Lakers, while the Kings prepare to host the Milwaukee Bucks.
