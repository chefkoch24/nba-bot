**Milwaukee Bucks 136 - 111 New Orleans Pelicans**  
The Milwaukee Bucks secured their sixth consecutive victory with a decisive 136-111 win over the New Orleans Pelicans. Giannis Antetokounmpo led the Bucks with 28 points and 11 rebounds, while contributions from Kevin Porter Jr. and Gary Trent Jr. helped maintain their lead. Despite only having eight available players, the Pelicans stayed competitive until the third quarter, led by Lester Quinones’ 21 points. The Bucks' decisive 9-1 run, highlighted by Gary Trent Jr.'s key shots, allowed them to rest their starters and prepare for their two-game series against the Detroit Pistons. With Indiana’s win over Cleveland, the Bucks need one win in their remaining games to secure the No. 5 seed in the East, while the Pelicans, suffering their fifth straight loss, will face the Miami Heat next.

**Detroit Pistons 115 - 106 New York Knicks**  
Cade Cunningham led the Detroit Pistons to a decisive 115-106 victory over the New York Knicks with an impressive 36 points and eight assists, potentially setting the stage for a first-round playoff clash between the two teams. Despite New York missing key players OG Anunoby and Josh Hart, and Jalen Brunson briefly exiting with an ankle injury, they maintained a lead for most of the game until Detroit surged ahead in the fourth quarter. Jalen Duren's flawless shooting and strong rebounding were pivotal, while Tobias Harris and rookie Ron Holland contributed valuable points. The Knicks' Karl-Anthony Towns countered with 25 points and 10 rebounds, and Precious Achiuwa added 18 points in a depleted lineup. Veteran P.J. Tucker saw significant action, playing 27 minutes. The Pistons snapped a four-game skid and secured a playoff berth, aided by Dennis Schroder's clutch play in the final minute. Coach J.B. Bickerstaff's critique of their rebounding spurred a stronger effort, as Detroit narrowly won the rebounding battle and capitalized on second-chance opportunities. Both teams face crucial games to close out the regular season, with Detroit meeting Milwaukee and New York facing off against Cleveland and Brooklyn.

**Indiana Pacers 114 - 112 Cleveland Cavaliers**  
The Indiana Pacers secured a significant victory, rallying to defeat the short-handed Cleveland Cavaliers 114-112, extending their winning streak to six games. Tyrese Haliburton was instrumental, scoring eight of his 23 points during a crucial fourth-quarter run, along with contributing 10 assists, eight rebounds, and three blocks. Aaron Nesmith added 22 points, while Myles Turner recorded 13 points, seven rebounds, and four blocks. This win secured the Pacers a top-four seed and home-court advantage in the playoffs, their first since 2014, and brought them close to their first 50-win season since 2013-14. Despite resting most starters, including Ty Jerome who scored 24 points before sitting out the final quarter, the Cavaliers showed depth with their bench's strong performance. Cleveland's coach, Kenny Atkinson, was ejected after arguing with officials, while Indiana capitalized on a 10-0 run in the final minutes and outperformed Cleveland in fast-break points. The result leaves the Pacers with a choice between preserving player energy or pushing for a higher playoff seed.

**Brooklyn Nets 109 - 133 Atlanta Hawks**  
Zaccharie Risacher dazzled with a season-high 38 points as the Atlanta Hawks decisively defeated the Brooklyn Nets 133-109. The rookie, who was the No. 1 draft pick, impressed by shooting 15-for-20 from the field and 6-for-11 from beyond the arc. Trae Young supported with 24 points and 12 assists, contributing to the Hawks' 57% shooting night. Dyson Daniels nearly notched a triple-double with 10 points, nine assists, nine rebounds, and three steals, further solidifying his case for Defensive Player of the Year. The Hawks never trailed, establishing a commanding 69-45 lead at halftime, and made their first 12 shots in the second quarter, a feat not seen since February 2023 against Cleveland. This victory allowed Atlanta to win the season series against Brooklyn for the first time since 2017-18. Risacher, who has scored 30 or more points in four games this season, is being heavily promoted by the team for Rookie of the Year honors.

**Memphis Grizzlies 125 - 141 Minnesota Timberwolves**  
In a pivotal matchup between teams battling to avoid the play-in tournament, the Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Memphis Grizzlies 141-125 in a high-scoring encounter. Anthony Edwards led the way for Minnesota with 44 points, notably scoring 18 during a record-setting 52-point third quarter, the highest-scoring quarter in the NBA this season. Julius Randle contributed significantly with 31 points and 10 rebounds, helping the Timberwolves shoot an impressive 85.7% in the third quarter. Minnesota's victory means they have now won six of their last seven games and are tied with the Golden State Warriors and Memphis in the standings, at 47-33. Ja Morant was the standout performer for the Grizzlies, scoring 36 points and adding flair with a grenade-toss celebration after a successful three-pointer. Despite showing potential with a recent three-game winning streak, Memphis's loss has put their hopes of avoiding the play-in tournament in jeopardy, compounded by committing 15 turnovers that gave Minnesota the edge. Both teams play again on Friday night, with Minnesota hosting the Brooklyn Nets and Memphis visiting the Denver Nuggets.
