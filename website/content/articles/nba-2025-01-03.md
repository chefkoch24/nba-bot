**Minnesota Timberwolves 115 - 118 Boston Celtics**  
Jayson Tatum led the Boston Celtics with 33 points, nine assists, and eight rebounds as they narrowly defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 118-115 in Minneapolis. Derrick White contributed 26 points, and Sam Hauser stepped up for the injured Jaylen Brown, scoring 15 points with five 3-pointers. Despite trailing by eight points with two minutes left, the Timberwolves, led by Julius Randle's 27 points, had a chance to push the game into overtime; however, Anthony Edwards' last-second 3-pointer missed the mark. A critical 16-6 run by the Celtics at the end of the second quarter, aided by Tatum’s shooting, gave them a crucial halftime lead. Boston's efficient play resulted in just four turnovers compared to Minnesota's sixteen. The victory marked a positive start to Boston's four-game road trip, while Minnesota faced another tough defeat after losing to Oklahoma City earlier in the week.

Jalen Williams contributed a crucial buzzer-beater at halftime and scored the first six points of the Thunder's 23-5 run that put them ahead for good. Oklahoma City's shooting improved from 31% in the first half to finish at 50%, while they added 11 steals to their league-leading total.

**Golden State Warriors 139 - 105 Philadelphia 76ers**  
In an NBA matchup slated Thursday night, the Philadelphia 76ers, playing under the guidance of coach Nick Nurse, aim to rebound against the Golden State Warriors following their collapse against the Sacramento Kings, where they squandered a nine-point lead to lose 113-107. Joel Embiid, their key player nursing a sore left foot, is expected to return after sitting out the defeat, echoing a similar pattern from last season when the 76ers also faced a challenging back-to-back loss against the Warriors. In contrast, the Warriors, who started the season strong with a 12-3 record but have struggled significantly, winning only four of their last 17 games, hope to find rhythm after a dismal showing against the Cavaliers, where Stephen Curry and Draymond Green had off nights. Warriors coach Steve Kerr emphasized the need for better shots and spacing to overcome the rut, while a bright spot remains Jonathan Kuminga's recent performances. The game will test 76ers' defensive progress, which Nurse believes has been crucial to their recent improvements, against a Warriors team eager to rediscover their shooting form.

**Los Angeles Lakers 114 - 106 Portland Trail Blazers**  
In a game marked by roster changes and missed opportunities, the Los Angeles Lakers showcased a revamped lineup after trading D'Angelo Russell to the Brooklyn Nets.

Anthony Davis contributed 28 points and 13 rebounds, while LeBron James added 23 points shortly after turning 40. New acquisition Dorian Finney-Smith had a quiet debut, impacting the team's cohesion only modestly. Meanwhile, the Portland Trail Blazers suffered a 125-103 home defeat to the Philadelphia 76ers, hindered by poor shooting and a season-high 26 turnovers. Anfernee Simons scored 25 points for Portland, while Deni Avdija struggled with 10 turnovers in the absence of Jerami Grant.
