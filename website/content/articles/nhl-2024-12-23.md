**New York Rangers 1 - 3 Carolina Hurricanes**  
In an impressive performance, Pyotr Kochetkov made 22 saves and contributed two assists to lead the Carolina Hurricanes to a 3-1 victory over the New York Rangers at Madison Square Garden. Kochetkov, who experienced his first two-point game at any level, helped the Hurricanes overcome an early deficit after Jimmy Vesey scored just 17 seconds into the match. Carolina's penalty kill was perfect, going 4-for-4, and Jack Roslovic broke the Rangers' streak of 20 consecutive successful penalty kills with a crucial power-play goal. The Hurricanes, who had been on a five-game road losing streak, controlled the game particularly in the second period, outshooting the Rangers 16-8, and successfully stifling New York's offense after the initial goal. Despite a strong performance from Igor Shesterkin with 28 saves, the Rangers lost their fourth straight at home and have struggled with penalty plays, failing to score on their last 12 opportunities. Sebastian Aho sealed the game with an empty-net goal, while Carolina maintained their dominant penalty kill record, going 23-for-23 in December.

**Tampa Bay Lightning 2 - 4 Florida Panthers**  
In a thrilling game, the Florida Panthers secured a 4-2 victory over the Tampa Bay Lightning at Amalie Arena, marking their fourth consecutive win. The second period saw crucial short-handed goals from A.J. Greer and Eetu Luostarinen within a 42-second span, seizing momentum from the Lightning. Sam Reinhart contributed with two goals, including an empty-netter, while Spencer Knight made 19 saves for the Panthers. The Lightning, despite goals from Nick Paul and Brayden Point, could not overcome the special teams deficit, as they conceded three special teams goals and failed to capitalize on the power play. Notably, Nikita Kucherov's nine-game point streak ended, although Point extended his to eight games. The teams will face off again in the second game of their back-to-back series in Sunrise.

Jakub Vrana added a crucial goal in the second period, assisted by recently acquired Pierre-Luc Dubois, who also tallied two assists against his former team.

Goalie Logan Thompson contributed significantly with 25 saves for the Capitals, while the Kings' David Rittich stopped 18 shots. Both teams exhibited playoff-style intensity, with the victory marking another strong defensive performance for the Capitals, as they have allowed two or fewer goals in seven of their last nine games.

The Avalanche extended their winning streak with contributions from Cale Makar, who had one goal and two assists, and Valeri Nichushkin, who scored once. Nathan MacKinnon and Mikko Rantanen each had two assists, helping the Avalanche win their third consecutive game and seven out of nine. The Kraken struggled despite goals from Jared McCann and recent acquisition Kaapo Kakko, marking their fifth straight loss. In a remarkable feat, Kiviranta's natural hat trick included two empty-net goals, making him the second Colorado player this season to achieve such a feat after Rantanen. The game also featured milestones such as Makar surpassing Kris Letang in multi-point games among active defensemen and Yanni Gourde recording his 200th career assist. Despite a resilient performance, the Kraken couldn't contain the Avalanche's offensive momentum, as they prepare for further growth in future games.
