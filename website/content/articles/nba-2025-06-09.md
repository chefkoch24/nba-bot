**Oklahoma City Thunder 123 - 107 Indiana Pacers**  
In a decisive response to their Game 1 loss, the Oklahoma City Thunder leveled the NBA Finals series by defeating the Indiana Pacers 123-107 in Game 2. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander spearheaded the victory with 34 points, marking a milestone of 3,000 points for the season and surpassing Jalen Brunson as the leading scorer of the playoffs. Despite Indiana's attempts to rally, the Thunder maintained control with a significant 19-2 run in the second quarter, securing their first finals game win since 2012. The Pacers struggled offensively, becoming the first team since 2013 without a 20-point scorer in the opening two finals games. The victory was part of Oklahoma City's pattern of bouncing back strongly after losses, as they've now achieved an 18-2 record on such occasions this season. The game set the stage for an awaited Game 3 in Indianapolis, which will host its first finals game in 25 years.
