**Toronto Maple Leafs 3 - 1 Detroit Red Wings**  
In the Hockey Hall of Fame game, John Tavares led the Toronto Maple Leafs to a 3-1 victory over the Detroit Red Wings at Scotiabank Arena, scoring two key goals, including one on the power play, and adding an empty-netter. Mitch Marner contributed a goal and an assist, extending his point streak to seven games, while Morgan Rielly provided two assists as the Leafs secured their second consecutive win. Toronto’s Anthony Stolarz made 21 saves, including a critical one late in the third period, helping maintain the lead after Dylan Larkin’s power-play goal had briefly tied the game for Detroit. Despite Cam Talbot's 17 saves for the Red Wings and a disallowed goal for the Leafs early on due to goalie interference, Toronto's strong performance on the power play proved decisive. The Leafs achieved this without their injured captain Auston Matthews, highlighting their depth and resilience.

**Washington Capitals 2 - 4 Pittsburgh Penguins**  
Evgeni Malkin played a crucial role in the Pittsburgh Penguins' 4-2 victory over the Washington Capitals, netting the go-ahead goal in the third period and providing an assist. Despite the Penguins entering the game following a heavy loss to the Carolina Hurricanes, they managed to secure the win at Capital One Arena, a venue where they've consistently performed well, accumulating points in six consecutive visits. Erik Karlsson also contributed significantly, with both a goal and an assist, while Noel Acciari sealed the game with an empty-netter. The game was marked by Bryan Rust's impactful return from injury and the historic 70th matchup between Sidney Crosby and Alex Ovechkin, although both Ovechkin and Capitals forward Dylan Strome saw their point streaks snapped. Pittsburgh's defensive effort in the third period impressed coach Mike Sullivan, highlighting an effective team performance against a Capitals team on a seven-game home winning streak.

**Anaheim Ducks 2 - 5 Minnesota Wild**  
In a dominant 5-2 victory over the Anaheim Ducks, the Minnesota Wild were spearheaded by Kirill Kaprizov, who impressed with two goals and an assist, continuing his streak of eight consecutive multipoint road games and taking the NHL points lead with 27. Kaprizov's effort contributed to Minnesota's best-ever start through 14 games, with the team winning five of their last six. Marco Rossi, Jake Middleton, and Marcus Foligno also found the net for the Wild, while Filip Gustavsson made 32 saves. The Wild's explosive three-goal burst in just over five minutes of the first period set the tone, and despite Robby Fabbri scoring his 100th NHL goal, Anaheim's power play struggles persisted as they went 0-for-6. Trevor Zegras missed a penalty shot, and the Ducks' losing streak extended to four games.
