**Washington Commanders 18 - 15 Chicago Bears**  
In a thrilling game at Northwest Stadium, Washington Commanders rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels pulled off an improbable 18-15 victory over the Chicago Bears with a last-second 52-yard Hail Mary touchdown pass to Noah Brown. Despite not witnessing the catch himself, Daniels threw the decisive pass after scrambling for 13 seconds and it was tipped by Zach Ertz before Brown caught it alone in the end zone. This dramatic finish capped an eventful game where Daniels, despite dealing with a rib injury, threw for 326 yards and solidified his candidacy for AP Offensive Rookie of the Year. Commanders kicker Austin Seibert maintained the team in contention with four field goals prior to the Hail Mary. On the Bears' side, rookie quarterback Caleb Williams struggled, completing only 10 of 24 passes for 131 yards, as their winning streak was halted. Both teams also faced injury challenges, with Chicago losing three offensive linemen and Washington's LT Cornelius Lucas leaving the game with an ankle issue. The Commanders will next visit the Giants, while the Bears head to Arizona.

**Denver Broncos 28 - 14 Carolina Panthers**  
In a standout performance, rookie quarterback Bo Nix led the Denver Broncos to a 28-14 victory over the injury-laden Carolina Panthers, throwing three touchdown passes and running for another. Despite losing two fumbles that led to the Panthers' only scores, the Broncos took control, with Nix accumulating 284 passing yards and connecting notably with Adam Trautman and Nate Adkins. Denver's defense proved formidable, intercepting Carolina's Bryce Young twice and sacking him twice. Young, returning as the Panthers' starter due to Andy Dalton's injury, threw his first touchdown pass of the season and had a strong finish with a late 98-yard drive. However, the Panthers' struggles continued with numerous injuries and ineffective play, marking their fifth straight loss. Denver's head coach Sean Payton criticized their overall performance, emphasizing the importance of improvement against tougher upcoming opponents like the Baltimore Ravens and Kansas City Chiefs. Notably, the Broncos celebrated their first tight end touchdowns of the season on National Tight Ends Day. Young’s future as a starter remains uncertain as Carolina assesses their quarterback options.

**New England Patriots 25 - 22 New York Jets**  
In a dramatic comeback, the New England Patriots defeated the New York Jets 25-22, snapping their six-game losing streak and securing their first home win in over a year. With promising rookie Drake Maye sidelined by a concussion, Jacoby Brissett stepped in to lead two crucial fourth-quarter scoring drives, including a decisive Rhamondre Stevenson touchdown with just 22 seconds left. Despite Aaron Rodgers' impressive performance with 233 passing yards and two touchdowns, the struggling Jets suffered their fifth consecutive loss. Jets' kicker Greg Zuerlein's missed kicks proved costly, and interim coach Jeff Ulbrich remains winless since taking over. The win ties both teams at 2-6 in the AFC East, while the Patriots hope this victory ignites a positive turnaround.

Despite an early scoring drive, the Bengals faltered, managing just 58 rushing yards and losing the turnover battle. The Eagles displayed proficiency on both sides of the ball, while Cincinnati struggled with consistency and injuries, including the absence of Tee Higgins and the loss of Orlando Brown during the game.

**Las Vegas Raiders 20 - 27 Kansas City Chiefs**  
The Kansas City Chiefs maintained their unbeaten streak with a hard-fought 27-20 win over the Las Vegas Raiders, improving to 7-0 for the season. Patrick Mahomes threw for 262 yards and two touchdowns, reaching 30,000 career passing yards faster than any other NFL quarterback. A critical sequence in the third quarter saw the Chiefs' defense prevent the Raiders from scoring after Mahomes threw an interception, with a big sack on fourth-and-goal at the 3-yard line. Travis Kelce was Mahomes' top receiver, catching 10 passes for 90 yards and a touchdown, surpassing Jason Witten for fifth on the all-time tight end touchdown list. Gardner Minshew of the Raiders completed 24 of 30 passes with two touchdowns, but was sacked five times, further hampered by a nearly ineffective running game. The Chiefs capitalized on 12 of 16 third downs, one of the highest conversion rates in the league this season. Despite their efforts, the Raiders could not capitalize on key opportunities, including a crucial possession just before halftime. Kansas City's defense ultimately sealed the victory with a strip sack and key defensive stops. Chiefs' recent acquisition, DeAndre Hopkins, had a quiet debut but is expected to see more action in upcoming games, while both teams dealt with injuries that could impact their future matchups.

**Jacksonville Jaguars 27 - 30 Green Bay Packers**  
The Green Bay Packers secured a thrilling 30-27 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars, marking their fourth consecutive win despite losing starting quarterback Jordan Love to a left groin injury early in the game. With Love sidelined, backup Malik Willis took charge, completing a game-changing 51-yard pass to Jayden Reed, setting up Brandon McManus for a decisive game-winning field goal, his second in as many weeks. Packers' running back Josh Jacobs delivered an impressive 127 yards with two touchdowns, while errors and penalties marred Jacksonville's performance, despite Trevor Lawrence's efforts to rally from a 10-point deficit with a late TD pass to Evan Engram. The Jaguars were further hampered by the loss of several key players to injuries, including three starting receivers, adding to their woes. Notably, McManus, formerly with Jacksonville, returned to successfully kick three field goals, defeating his past team and overcoming off-field controversies from his stint there. The Packers will next face the Detroit Lions, while the Jaguars prepare to take on the Eagles.

Kirk Cousins led the Atlanta Falcons to a 31-26 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, throwing for 276 yards and four touchdowns, thus solidifying the Falcons' position atop the NFC South. In a game that marked Raheem Morris' first season as Atlanta's head coach, Cousins connected with Kyle Pitts twice for scores, contributing to a season sweep over the Buccaneers, who are now second in the division. Despite Baker Mayfield's 330-yard, three-touchdown performance for Tampa Bay, his two interceptions proved costly, and a last-minute Hail Mary attempt fell short. The Bucs, donning their retro Creamsicle jerseys, struggled with injuries and continued to face a challenging season as their core receivers were sidelined. Meanwhile, Atlanta's defense capitalized with key interceptions from Jessie Bates III and A.J. Terrell Jr., helping the team win four of their last five games following a sluggish start.

Quarterback Justin Herbert contributed 328 total yards with two touchdown passes, guiding the Chargers to rebound from a previous loss. Despite an early safety, the Saints struggled offensively, failing to reach the red zone and relying on kicker Blake Grupe for their scoring. The Saints have now lost six games in a row, heightening pressure on coach Dennis Allen. The game also highlighted a rare achievement by Chargers fullback and defensive tackle Scott Matlock, who recorded both a sack and a reception. Both teams faced injuries, further complicating their seasons as they prepare for upcoming matches.

**Seattle Seahawks 10 - 31 Buffalo Bills**  
In a dominant performance, the Buffalo Bills, led by Josh Allen’s two touchdown passes, overwhelmed the Seattle Seahawks 31-10. Allen, completing 24 of 34 for 283 yards, shrugged off his first interception of the season by spearheading a 12-play, 93-yard touchdown drive shortly after, padding Buffalo's lead. James Cook was stellar on the ground, rushing for 117 yards and two touchdowns. The Bills' offense meticulously controlled the game, totaling 445 yards and holding possession for over 38 minutes. Buffalo achieved two 90-yard touchdown drives in the first half, a feat last accomplished in 2022. Meanwhile, Seattle struggled offensively, managing only 233 yards and 32 rushing yards, and tensions erupted on the sidelines with defensive players throwing punches. Despite Allen’s interception, the Seahawks couldn’t capitalize, compounding the team's recent struggles with their fourth loss in five games.

**San Francisco 49ers 30 - 24 Dallas Cowboys**  
In a strong comeback performance, Brock Purdy helped the San Francisco 49ers defeat the Dallas Cowboys 30-24, despite a rocky start. The 49ers, entering their bye week at 4-4, capitalized on a dominant third quarter where they scored 21 points, turning a 10-6 halftime deficit into a 27-10 lead. Purdy, who had struggled the previous week against Kansas City, threw for 260 yards, with a touchdown pass to George Kittle, who had 128 receiving yards. Additionally, Purdy scored a touchdown himself on a sneak, showcasing his resilience after his earlier three-interception game. CeeDee Lamb was a standout for Dallas with 146 yards and two touchdowns, while Dak Prescott's performance was marred by inconsistent showing and two interceptions for the third consecutive game, marking an unfortunate streak not seen in 32 years for a Cowboys quarterback. Despite a late push by Dallas, the 49ers secured victory with a crucial defensive stand in the final minutes. The win sets a confident tone for San Francisco, reminiscent of their post-bye surges in recent seasons, while increasing the pressure on Cowboys' coach Mike McCarthy, whose team fell to 3-4.

**Miami Dolphins 27 - 28 Arizona Cardinals**  
In a thrilling contest, the Arizona Cardinals edged out the Miami Dolphins 28-27, marking consecutive last-second victories thanks to Chad Ryland's clutch field goals. Kyler Murray led an impressive comeback in the fourth quarter, erasing a nine-point deficit by orchestrating two scoring drives, the second culminating in Ryland’s decisive 34-yard kick. The win, which spoiled Tua Tagovailoa's return from a concussion, saw the Cardinals achieve back-to-back victories for the first time since 2021, showcasing standout performances from rookie Marvin Harrison Jr. and tight end Trey McBride, who both surpassed 100 receiving yards. Despite Tagovailoa's solid showing, with 234 passing yards and noteworthy plays that drew admiration from fans, Miami fell just short, though they delivered their best offensive game of the season. Murray, evading pressure effectively, completed 26 of 36 passes for 307 yards and two touchdowns, underscoring his playmaking ability that overcame Miami's highly-ranked pass defense.

**Cleveland Browns 29 - 24 Baltimore Ravens**  
In a dramatic comeback, the Cleveland Browns snapped a five-game losing streak by defeating the Baltimore Ravens 29-24, led by Jameis Winston who threw for 334 yards and three touchdowns, including a crucial 38-yard pass to Cedric Tillman with under a minute remaining. This victory was significant as it marked Winston's first start in over two years, stepping in for the injured Deshaun Watson, and brought hope to a struggling season. Baltimore's Lamar Jackson nearly orchestrated a last-minute comeback but was thwarted by Cleveland's defense, resulting in a rare emotional outburst from Jackson as the Ravens' impressive winning streak came to an end. The game was further imbued with sentiment as Browns fans and the team mourned the loss of beloved broadcaster Jim Donovan, to whom the game was dedicated. Adding to the narrative, Nick Chubb made strides on Cleveland’s all-time rushing list while the game also witnessed some injuries, including Cleveland's Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah being carted off with a neck injury.

Mixon showcased his prowess by rushing for 102 yards and a touchdown, marking a historic achievement as the first player to have at least 100 yards rushing and a TD in four of his first five games with a team. Notably, he fumbled late in the game but was bailed out by a review that nullified a potential Colts' lead. Stroud, rebounding from a challenging previous week, threw for 285 yards and a touchdown, as Houston extended its lead in the AFC South. The game also saw Texans' Stefon Diggs leave with an injury, while Colts' Anthony Richardson struggled, completing only 10 of 32 passes.
