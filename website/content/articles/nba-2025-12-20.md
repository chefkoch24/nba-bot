**Boston Celtics 129 - 116 Miami Heat**  
Derrick White's impressive performance, scoring a season-high 33 points and tying a career-high with nine 3-pointers, propelled the Boston Celtics to a 129-116 victory over the Miami Heat, ending Boston's two-game losing streak. Jaylen Brown contributed significantly with 30 points, nine rebounds, and seven assists. Boston dominated the fourth quarter with a decisive 20-7 run, extending their lead to 19 points, and connected on 21 three-pointers throughout the game. Despite Kel’el Ware's strong showing for the Heat with 24 points and 14 rebounds, Miami struggled, losing six of their last seven games, shooting only 39% from the field. The Heat, facing multiple injuries, relied on rookie Kasparas Jakucionis, who added 17 points and five 3-pointers in his first career start, but were hampered by just seven second-chance points in the second half. The Celtics are set to play the Raptors next, while the Heat will face the Knicks.

**New York Knicks 107 - 116 Philadelphia 76ers**  
The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the New York Knicks 116-107 at Madison Square Garden, becoming only the second visiting team to win there this season. Tyrese Maxey led the 76ers with 30 points, while VJ Edgecombe contributed 23 points. Andre Drummond, stepping in for the ill and injured Joel Embiid, added 14 points and 13 rebounds, notably going 3 for 4 from beyond the arc. The 76ers snapped the Knicks' six-game winning streak by outscoring them 28-20 in the final quarter, with Maxey scoring 11 points and Jalen Brunson missing all five of his shots in that stretch. Despite Brunson's 22 points, nine assists, and six rebounds, his shooting struggles were a setback following his clutch performance against Indiana the previous night. In a notable individual effort, Mitchell Robinson delivered his best game of the season with 21 points and 16 rebounds, excelling at the free-throw line after a rough start to the season. The Knicks, who were celebrating their recent NBA Cup title, chose not to hang a commemorative banner, a decision diverging from previous champions like the Lakers and Bucks. The 76ers next host Dallas, while the Knicks play Miami.

**Cleveland Cavaliers 125 - 136 Chicago Bulls**  
In an exciting Friday night matchup, the Chicago Bulls defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 136-125, powered by strong performances from Matas Buzelis and Nikola Vucevic, who both scored 24 points. Vucevic, dominating with 15 rebounds, played a crucial role in the fourth quarter, scoring 11 points and securing six boards to lead the Bulls to consecutive wins for the first time since November 19. Chicago saw seven players score in double figures, with Josh Giddey contributing 17 points and Tre Jones adding 16 off the bench. Cleveland, missing All-Star Donovan Mitchell due to illness, fought back from a 14-point deficit with a 27-9 run but couldn't maintain momentum. Darius Garland shone with a season-high 35 points, but the Cavaliers' struggles continued, having lost three straight and five of their last six home games. The game was tightly contested at 115 before Chicago seized control with a decisive 17-8 run. The officiating crew was reduced to two after Tre Maddox injured his leg in the first quarter, leaving Ray Acosta and Phenizee Ransom to finish the game. The Bulls next face the Atlanta Hawks on Sunday, while the Cavaliers will host the Charlotte Hornets on Monday.

In a compelling NBA matchup, the Oklahoma City Thunder, boasting a 25-2 record, will seek consecutive wins as they face the Minnesota Timberwolves, who are adjusting without their star Anthony Edwards due to a foot injury.

Timberwolves players Julius Randle and Donte DiVincenzo have stepped up in Edwards' absence, with DiVincenzo recording a noteworthy double-double in a recent loss to the Memphis Grizzlies.

Both teams are looking to capitalize on their current form, with Thunder coach Mark Daigneault emphasizing the importance of each game's context in their stellar season.
