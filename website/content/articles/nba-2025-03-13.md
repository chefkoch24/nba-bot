Despite Dallas maintaining their position in the Western Conference play-in tournament at 10th place, Fox's standout game marked his highest scoring since joining the Spurs from Sacramento. San Antonio's Keldon Johnson and Jeremy Sochan contributed 18 points each off the bench, while Dallas, without key players like Kyrie Irving and Anthony Davis, relied on Brandon Williams’ 19 points in his return from injury.

**Denver Nuggets 95 - 115 Minnesota Timberwolves**  
The Minnesota Timberwolves extended their winning streak to six games with a commanding 115-95 victory over the Denver Nuggets, led by Anthony Edwards' 29 points and Julius Randle's 25. Rudy Gobert contributed a double-double with 11 points and 10 rebounds, helping Minnesota improve to 3-0 against the Nuggets this season. Even though Denver's Nikola Jokic shone with 34 points and a standout fast-break dunk, his efforts weren't enough to overcome the Timberwolves' solid defense, which limited the Nuggets' usually high league-leading averages. Denver struggled offensively, shooting just 40.4% and trailing throughout the game, even after a strong previous performance against Oklahoma City. The Timberwolves' bench outperformed Denver's reserves, providing a significant boost to secure their longest winning streak of the season.

**Portland Trail Blazers 113 - 114 New York Knicks**  
The New York Knicks snapped their three-game losing streak with a dominant 133-104 victory over the Sacramento Kings, buoyed by hot 3-point shooting and robust defense. Despite missing All-Star guard Jalen Brunson due to an ankle injury, the Knicks excelled with a collective effort as Karl-Anthony Towns led with 26 points and nine rebounds, and OG Anunoby contributed significantly with 24 points, eight assists, and five steals. Miles McBride, stepping up in Brunson's absence, notched 21 points with efficient shooting, while Josh Hart added 18 points. The Knicks capitalized on defense, converting it into offense, a strategy likely adopted in the upcoming game against the Portland Trail Blazers. Meanwhile, Portland struggles, having lost four straight games, with their recent 130-120 loss to the Golden State Warriors despite Deni Avdija's impressive performance of 34 points and 16 rebounds. Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups acknowledged the impact of turnovers, as the team committed 19, contributing to their defeat. Portland, shaky in playoff contention, faces a critical seven-game homestand beginning with this matchup against New York, who has won the last three encounters with the Blazers.
