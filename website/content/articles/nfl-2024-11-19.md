**Dallas Cowboys 10 - 34 Houston Texans**  
The Houston Texans seized a commanding 34-10 victory over the Dallas Cowboys, marking the Cowboys' fifth consecutive loss this season and extending their troubling home losing streak. Key defensive plays by Derek Barnett, including a fumble return for a touchdown, coupled with Joe Mixon's three touchdowns, facilitated the Texans' dominant performance. Mixon, now with a six-game touchdown streak since returning from an ankle injury, contributed significantly to the Texans' efforts. Despite early promise, the Cowboys struggled, with quarterback Cooper Rush losing his second start following Dak Prescott's injury. The loss extended Dallas' longest losing streak since 2015 and made them the first NFL team to trail by at least 20 points in six consecutive home games. C.J. Stroud managed the game effectively for the Texans, accumulating 257 yards. With ongoing challenges, including injuries to key players like Zack Martin and Tyler Smith, the Cowboys' season continues to falter as they prepare to face Washington next, while the Texans look to build momentum against Tennessee.
