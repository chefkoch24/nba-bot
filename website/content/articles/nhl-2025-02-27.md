**Ottawa Senators 1 - 4 Winnipeg Jets**  
The Winnipeg Jets secured their 11th consecutive victory, a franchise record, by defeating the Ottawa Senators 4-1 at the Canadian Tire Centre. Despite not being at their best, Winnipeg managed to maintain their winning streak, partially due to stellar performances by Connor Hellebuyck, who made 24 saves, and contributions from Kyle Connor and Mark Scheifele, both scoring a goal and providing an assist. The Senators, now on a five-game losing streak, were missing key players like Brady Tkachuk and Josh Norris due to injuries. Tim Stutzle extended his point streak to ten games with an assist, while Linus Ullmark made 35 saves but allowed Ottawa's only goal, scored by Thomas Chabot. Hellebuyck's current streak of eight wins in a row is the longest in the NHL this season, underscoring his crucial role in the Jets' success, which includes their exceptional 25-3-2 record when scoring first this season.

**Colorado Avalanche 5 - 1 New Jersey Devils**  
In a commanding 5-1 victory against the New Jersey Devils at Ball Arena, Nathan MacKinnon led the Colorado Avalanche with two pivotal goals and an assist. The Avalanche, who had been on a two-game losing streak since the 4 Nations Face-Off break, also received contributions from Martin Necas, with three assists, and goals from Artturi Lehkonen, Casey Mittelstadt, and Logan O'Connor. Colorado's Cale Makar added two assists while Mackenzie Blackwood made 22 saves. The Devilsâ€™ Jack Hughes provided the sole response with a one-timer, but the team's alternating win-loss pattern persisted as goaltender Jake Allen conceded five goals on 36 shots before being replaced by Nico Daws. Among the highlights was MacKinnon's second goal, a power-play tally where he impressively batted the puck out of mid-air to extend the Avalanche's advantage in the third period.
