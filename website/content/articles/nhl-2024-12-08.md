**Boston Bruins 4 - 3 Philadelphia Flyers**  
The Boston Bruins secured a dramatic 4-3 overtime victory over the Philadelphia Flyers at TD Garden, marking their fourth consecutive win. Pavel Zacha scored the game-winning goal in overtime following a strong forecheck and assist from David Pastrnak; it was his second overtime goal in three games. The Bruins showcased resilience by rallying from a 3-1 deficit in the third period with key goals from Trent Frederic, who scored twice, and Brad Marchand, who notched a tying goal with less than six minutes left. Philly's Matvei Michkov stood out with two early goals, marking his third straight multipoint game, but the Flyers fell short after also blowing a lead in their previous game against Florida. This loss highlighted Philadelphia's current struggle with maintaining third-period leads, prompting concern from captain Sean Couturier about the team's discipline. Jeremy Swayman made a crucial overtime save to keep Boston in the game, while Travis Konecny missed the latter part of the match due to coaching decisions despite being cleared to return after a precautionary removal.
