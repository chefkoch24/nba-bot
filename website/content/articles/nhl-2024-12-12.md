**Buffalo Sabres 2 - 3 New York Rangers**  
The New York Rangers snapped their rough patch by defeating the Buffalo Sabres 3-2 at the KeyBank Center, condemning Buffalo to their eighth consecutive loss. Adam Fox was pivotal for the Rangers, contributing a goal and two assists, while Mika Zibanejad celebrated a personal milestone by netting his 300th NHL goal. Rangers goaltender Igor Shesterkin made 29 saves to assist in their victory, marking their third win in 11 games. Despite a late surge from the Sabres, with Owen Power producing a goal and assist, Buffalo's early errors, particularly in puck management, proved costly. Sabres' coach Lindy Ruff expressed dissatisfaction with the constant turnovers and suboptimal plays. Reilly Smith and Fox added to the Rangers' tally, with Fox scoring into an empty net for his first of the season. The game also marked a personal achievement for Artemi Panarin, who played his 700th NHL game. Additionally, K'Andre Miller sat out the third period due to an upper-body issue, while the Sabres welcomed back Mattias Samuelsson after missing 12 games.
