**Florida Panthers 0 - 4 Montreal Canadiens**  
Dobes has shutout in NHL debut for Canadiens against Panthers
 **SUNRISE, Fla. --** <forge-entity title="Jakub Dobes" slug="jakub-dobes-8482487" code="player">Jakub Dobes</forge-entity> made 34 saves in his NHL debut, and the Montreal Canadiens shut out the Florida Panthers 4-0 at Amerant Bank Arena on Saturday. 
Dobes, who was recalled from Laval of the American Hockey League on Friday, is the fourth goalie in Canadiens history to have a shutout in his debut.

"Hockey is unpredictable,'' the 23-year-old said. "You never know. You just have to show up, work hard, and that is what happened. I am very happy about the result."

<forge-entity title="Kirby Dach" slug="kirby-dach-8481523" code="player">Kirby Dach</forge-entity> scored twice for Montreal (15-17-3), which has won four of five.

"When you have a game like that, it is great, it brings confidence into the room and to the group in how we're doing it," Canadiens coach Martin St. Louis said. "But you have to turn the page. Enjoy it, but turn the page. I want to see the maturity from them when the puck drops tomorrow (against the Tampa Bay Lightning)." 
<forge-entity title="Spencer Knight" slug="spencer-knight-8481519" code="player">Spencer Knight</forge-entity> made 21 saves for Florida (22-13-2), which has been shut out in consecutive games (lost 4-0 to Tampa Bay Lightning on Monday) and had won nine straight home games against Montreal.

"I don't think we ever got to the level we need to get to for a chance to win a game," Panthers coach Paul Maurice said. "We allowed it to be even for the first part of that game. Then we made some mistakes, big ones, and were chasing the game. They played well, they played hard. We did not play a game we would recognize as our own."

Dach made it 1-0 at 1:39 of the second period. He missed a cross-ice pass from <forge-entity title="Alex Newhook" slug="alex-newhook-8481618" code="player">Alex Newhook</forge-entity>, but the puck went off his left skate and past Knight.

Dach then extended the lead to 2-0 at 13:51 with a backhand on a breakaway. 
"We are playing good teams and playing good hockey right now," Dach said. "We want to keep this rolling. We have a lot of big games coming up, teams who are in a playoff position. We want to prove ourselves as a playoff team.''

<forge-entity title="Jake Evans" slug="jake-evans-8478133" code="player">Jake Evans</forge-entity> scored his third short-handed goal of the season at 17:19 to make it 3-0. He intercepted a pass in the neutral zone before scoring on a wrist shot from the left circle.

<forge-entity title="Cole Caufield" slug="cole-caufield-8481540" code="player">Cole Caufield</forge-entity> made it 4-0 at 14:17 of the third period. <forge-entity title="Juraj Slafkovsky" slug="juraj-slafkovsky-8483515" code="player">Juraj Slafkovsky</forge-entity> picked off a loose puck in the neutral zone and found Caufield in the slot.

Dobes made 10 saves in the third to preserve the shutout.

"All I know is, the guys in front of me did an unbelievable job," Dobes said. "I think I saw every puck, and that gave me a lot of confidence." 
Montreal had not won at Florida since Dec. 28, 2018.

"We understand the caliber of team we were playing," St. Louis said. "But this wasn't just a win, but how we got it. I thought we played a smart, calculated game."

The Panthers, who have been shut out four times in their past eight games, next play the New York Rangers on Monday.

"I don’t think we are going to dwell on this one, just kind of move on," forward <forge-entity title="Sam Bennett" slug="sam-bennett-8477935" code="player">Sam Bennett</forge-entity> said. "Mistakes are going to be made; it's about how you help each other and fix them. We are just going to move on from this game."

**NOTES:** Dobes is the seventh goalie in NHL history to defeat the defending Stanley Cup champions in his debut, and the first since Reto Berra of the Calgary Flames against the Chicago Blackhawks on Nov. 3, 2013. Dobes also joined <forge-entity title="John Gibson" slug="john-gibson-8476434" code="player">John Gibson</forge-entity> of the Anaheim Ducks as the only active goalies to have a shutout in his NHL debut (minimum one game played this season). … Caufield has 12 goals on the road this season, tied for third in the NHL behind <forge-entity title="Sam Reinhart" slug="sam-reinhart-8477933" code="player">Sam Reinhart</forge-entity> of the Panthers (14) and <forge-entity title="Brayden Point" slug="brayden-point-8478010" code="player">Brayden Point</forge-entity> of the Lightning (13).

**Vancouver Canucks 4 - 5 Seattle Kraken**  
The Seattle Kraken staged a remarkable late-game comeback, scoring three goals in the third period to overcome a 4-1 deficit and ultimately defeat the Vancouver Canucks 5-4 in overtime. Vince Dunn, who scored twice and added an assist, netted the game-winner on a breakaway, capitalizing on a Canucks turnover. Jaden Schwartz contributed significantly with two late goals, marking his 500th NHL point, while Matty Beniers ended a 20-game goalless streak. Seattle's comeback marked their league-leading fifth multigoal comeback of the season and made them the third team in NHL history to win a regular-season game after trailing by three goals in the final five minutes. The victory snapped the Kraken's five-game losing streak and highlighted the resilience of the team, despite missing key players like Joey Daccord and Andre Burakovsky. Vancouver, missing Quinn Hughes and Elias Pettersson, had goals from Brock Boeser and Jake DeBrusk, with standout moments from Thatcher Demko's 24 saves, but were unable to maintain their lead and secure the win.

**Anaheim Ducks 1 - 3 Philadelphia Flyers**  
In a match at Honda Center, Noah Cates scored in his fifth consecutive game to help the Philadelphia Flyers edge past the Anaheim Ducks with a 3-1 victory. Alongside Cates, Morgan Frost and Joel Farabee found the net for the Flyers as goaltender Samuel Ersson made a significant impact with 32 saves. The Flyers opened their five-game road trip with this victory after losing four of their previous five games. As the game progressed, Troy Terry briefly equalized for the Ducks before Frost restored Philadelphia’s lead in the third period, using a clever bank off Ducks goalie Lukas Dostal. Farabee secured the win with an empty-netter. Flyers coach John Tortorella benched rookie forward Matvei Michkov for the third period due to energy concerns, contributing to the narrative as the Flyers displayed strong defensive capabilities. Meanwhile, Cutter Gauthier and Jamie Drysdale played against their former teams following a recent trade, adding an intriguing twist to the encounter.

This victory marked the Kings' sixth consecutive home win.

Notably, Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl each extended their point streaks to 10 games, with McDavid reaching his 100th assist during the calendar year, joining Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux as players with multiple years of 100 assists. The game was an emotionally charged affair, with former teammates Warren Foegele and Viktor Arvidsson playing pivotal roles against their previous teams, while Foegele's line, including Byfield and Tanner Jeannot, combined for a notable seven points and a plus-7 rating.

**Boston Bruins 4 - 0 Columbus Blue Jackets**  
 Swayman makes 18 saves, Bruins shut out Blue Jackets 
 <forge-entity title="Jeremy Swayman" slug="jeremy-swayman-8480280" code="player">Jeremy Swayman</forge-entity> made 18 saves for the Boston Bruins, who defeated the Columbus Blue Jackets 4-0 at TD Garden in Boston on Saturday. 
It was Swayman's second shutout this season and 14th in the NHL.

“That’s the character of this locker room and the D corps, the guys in front of me, and the forwards,” Swayman said. “We’re doing it for each other, and it’s a feel-good win when we’re doing that.” 
<forge-entity title="Morgan Geekie" slug="morgan-geekie-8479987" code="player">Morgan Geekie</forge-entity> had a goal and an assist, and <forge-entity title="Justin Brazeau" slug="justin-brazeau-8479638" code="player">Justin Brazeau</forge-entity>, <forge-entity title="David Pastrnak" slug="david-pastrnak-8477956" code="player">David Pastrnak</forge-entity> and <forge-entity title="Cole Koepke" slug="cole-koepke-8481043" code="player">Cole Koepke</forge-entity> scored for the Bruins (20-14-4), who were coming off a 6-2 loss at Columbus on Friday but are 5-1-1 in their past seven games.

“For the most part our guys were really committed here tonight, and even towards the end of the game, you could see we had a few guys blocking shots,” Bruins coach Joe Sacco said. “I thought it was a professional game for us here tonight after last night's game.”

<forge-entity title="Daniil Tarasov" slug="daniil-tarasov-8476549" code="player">Daniil Tarasov</forge-entity> made 24 saves in his first start since Dec. 5 for the Blue Jackets (15-16-6), who had their four-game point streak end (3-0-1).

“I thought it was not a bad road game per se,” Columbus forward <forge-entity title="Mathieu Olivier" slug="mathieu-olivier-8479671" code="player">Mathieu Olivier</forge-entity> said. “Just every big mistake kind of ended up in the back of our net.

“We expected their best. Obviously, we beat them twice already this year and we're coming back in their building. I didn't think it was all that bad, just couldn't get it going offensively, but whenever we gave up some goals it was kind of on us.” 
Brazeau gave the Bruins a 1-0 lead at 2:29 of the first period, knocking the rebound of <forge-entity title="Brandon Carlo" slug="brandon-carlo-8478443" code="player">Brandon Carlo</forge-entity>'s point shot in at the left post before Blue Jackets forward <forge-entity title="Mikael Pyyhtia" slug="mikael-pyyhtia-8482451" code="player">Mikael Pyyhtia</forge-entity> could clear it away.

Geekie increased the lead to 2-0 at 6:29 of the second period. He scored glove side with a wrist shot from the top of the left circle after Blue Jackets defenseman <forge-entity title="Damon Severson" slug="damon-severson-8476923" code="player">Damon Severson</forge-entity> blindly cleared the puck into the slot from the corner.

“When you're out on the road and you're not playing well or, sorry, you're not having success, you need to really simplify your game and not turn it over," Blue Jackets coach Dean Evason said. 
Pastrnak made it 3-0 at 8:18, scoring on a breakaway following another turnover by the Blue Jackets.

“I think today we shot ourselves in the foot a little bit," Columbus defenseman <forge-entity title="Dante Fabbro" slug="dante-fabbro-8479371" code="player">Dante Fabbro</forge-entity> said. "You look back at some of the goals, and even the one I coughed up at the blue line, and they end up going down and scoring.”

Koepke pushed it to 4-0 at 6:06 of the third period. He picked up a loose puck in the neutral zone, skated in on a rush, and beat Tarasov blocker side from the top of the right circle.

“Even though we had a little bit of a lapse (on Friday), it was good to see the way the team responded and play the right way for a full game,” Koepke said. “When we can get goals from all four lines and the defensemen and everyone kind of joining the play, it helps the whole team to get into a better rhythm and it’s easier to execute the game plan.” 
Bruins forward <forge-entity title="Fabian Lysell" slug="fabian-lysell-8482763" code="player">Fabian Lysell</forge-entity> was plus-1 in 11:32 of ice time in his NHL debut after being recalled from Providence of the American Hockey League on Saturday. The 21-year-old forward was selected with the No. 21 pick in the 2021 NHL Draft.

“I thought he handled himself well,” Sacco said. “It's obviously an exciting night for him, his family. He was on the ice for the first goal, which is always a good feeling. He did some good things. He was trying to be very responsible away from the puck.”

**Toronto Maple Leafs 2 - 5 Washington Capitals**  
In Alex Ovechkin's first game back after a 16-game absence due to a fractured fibula, the Washington Capitals secured a 5-2 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs at Scotiabank Arena. The Capitals, who went 10-5-1 without their star player, saw contributions from Andrew Mangiapane and Jakob Chychrun, each tallying a goal and an assist, while Logan Thompson made 35 crucial saves. Ovechkin's empty-net goal marked his 60th career empty-netter, a record in the NHL, and his 869th career goal, putting him 26 goals shy of Wayne Gretzky's all-time record. Capitals coach Spencer Carbery acknowledged a bit of rust but praised the team's third-period performance and resilience. Toronto's coach Craig Berube noted that their three errors proved costly, as Matt Murray’s 27 saves were not enough to stop Ovechkin and the Capitals. Despite the defeat, the Maple Leafs managed to tie twice early in the game through John Tavares and Bobby McMann but couldn't overcome the strong finish from Washington.

Despite the scoreline, Lightning coach Jon Cooper suggested the match was more competitive, with Tampa Bay capitalizing on their chances, including two short-handed goals. Goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy was pivotal, making 42 saves to fend off numerous Rangers chances. For the Rangers, Vincent Trocheck was a standout with a goal and an assist, but their recent struggles continued as they suffered their sixth loss in seven games.

**Carolina Hurricanes 5 - 2 New Jersey Devils**  
In an exciting matchup at Lenovo Center in Raleigh, the Carolina Hurricanes overcame the New Jersey Devils with a 5-2 victory, highlighted by Jack Roslovic's impressive two goals and an assist, as well as their dramatic four-goal surge in the third period. Sebastian Aho contributed a goal and an assist, while rookie Jackson Blake scored the decisive go-ahead goal, marking his fourth game-winning score of the season. Seth Jarvis added three assists for Carolina, who halted a recent slump of three losses in four games. This victory marked a milestone for coach Rod Brind'Amour, who became the fastest in NHL history to achieve 300 wins. On the opposing side, the Devils, despite goals from Paul Cotter and Ondrej Palat, saw their winning streak snapped, with coach Sheldon Keefe lamenting poor game management in the third period. Jasper Bratt assisted on Palat's early third-period goal that initially put the Devils ahead. Timo Meier's major penalty for kneeing Martin Necas was pivotal, leading to Blake's power-play goal that shifted momentum in Carolina's favor. Carolina's performance not only secured their 12th comeback win of the season, tying them with the Devils and Winnipeg Jets for the third-most in the league, but also underscored the strength of their group as emphasized by Brind'Amour.

**Winnipeg Jets 4 - 2 Ottawa Senators**  
The Winnipeg Jets secured their third consecutive win by overcoming a 2-0 deficit to defeat the Ottawa Senators 4-2 at Canada Life Centre.

The Jets showcased resilience and structure, rallying with goals from Kyle Connor, Mark Scheifele, and Ehlers, demonstrating their offensive prowess.

Notably, Claude Giroux reached his 400th career power-play point, while Stutzle continued his impressive performance, reaching 40 points in 35 games.

**New York Islanders 6 - 3 Pittsburgh Penguins**  
In an exciting match at UBS Arena, Casey Cizikas and Anders Lee each scored twice to propel the New York Islanders to a 6-3 victory over the Pittsburgh Penguins. Jean-Gabriel Pageau and Anthony Duclair added goals for the Islanders, with Mathew Barzal and Alexander Romanov contributing two assists each. Despite the Penguins' Rickard Rakell notching a goal and an assist, Michael Bunting and Noel Acciari's efforts weren't enough to prevent the loss. Islanders' coach Patrick Roy praised his team's strong, 60-minute defensive performance holding the opposers under 25 shots, while Duclair impressed with a point streak after his 28-game injury absence. The Penguins, critiqued for their lack of simplicity and puck decisions by coach Mike Sullivan, will get a chance to rebound in the second game of a home-and-home series the next day in Pittsburgh.
