**Buffalo Sabres 0 - 1 Minnesota Wild**  
Gustavsson makes 39 saves, Wild shut out Sabres
 **BUFFALO --** <forge-entity title="Filip Gustavsson" slug="filip-gustavsson-8479406" code="player">Filip Gustavsson</forge-entity> made 39 saves for the Minnesota Wild in a 1-0 win against the Buffalo Sabres at KeyBank Center on Wednesday. 
It was the second shutout of the season and eighth in the NHL for Gustavsson, who made 16 saves in the first period and 14 in the third.

“They’re a very good offensive team,” Gustavsson said. “We knew they were going to get a few chances. I thought we blocked a fair amount of shots (32) out there and limited their chances somewhat. I think a really good effort from our side.”

<forge-entity title="Kirill Kaprizov" slug="kirill-kaprizov-8478864" code="player">Kirill Kaprizov</forge-entity> scored for the Wild (14-4-4), who had lost two in a row and lead the NHL with a 10-1-3 road record.

“I think starting on the road with that long road trip (going 5-1-1 in seven games from Oct. 13-29), we learned how to play on the road really quick,” Minnesota defenseman <forge-entity title="Declan Chisholm" slug="declan-chisholm-8480990" code="player">Declan Chisholm</forge-entity> said. “We’ve become really tight on the road and I don’t think it’s changing anything about our game.” 
<forge-entity title="Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen" slug="ukko-pekka-luukkonen-8480045" code="player">Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen</forge-entity> made 28 saves for the Sabres (11-10-1), who had won three straight and were shut out for the first time this season.

“Honestly, I think we played a really good game tonight,” Buffalo center <forge-entity title="Tage Thompson" slug="tage-thompson-8479420" code="player">Tage Thompson</forge-entity> said. “I don’t think we can let that discourage us. Obviously, it stings when you lose, especially one like that where you feel like you outplayed them most of the night. Sometimes you run into a hot goalie and \[there’s\] not much you can do. You’ve just got to find ways to get one.”

Kaprizov scored at 6:55 of the first period. He converted on a one-timer from low in the right face-off circle off a touch pass from <forge-entity title="Joel Eriksson Ek" slug="joel-eriksson-ek-8478493" code="player">Joel Eriksson Ek</forge-entity> on a 4-on-1 rush. Defenseman <forge-entity title="Brock Faber" slug="brock-faber-8482122" code="player">Brock Faber</forge-entity> started the rush when he blocked Rasmus Dahlin’s centering pass from down low and then carried the puck out of the zone.

“He’s been obviously such a clutch player for us all year long,” Minnesota coach John Hynes said of Kaprizov, “and that was a big one, game-winner tonight and one was enough. But he’s really done a nice job. He’s producing points the right way. He’s competitive, but I think … \[he’s\] really understanding how to play in these types of games when you get offense but it doesn't come easy or the pucks don’t go in. I think his checking game is also at a high level.” 
With Buffalo pressing in the third, Gustavsson was square to get in front of a one-timer from <forge-entity title="Jiri Kulich" slug="jiri-kulich-8483468" code="player">Jiri Kulich</forge-entity> from the inside of the left circle that hit his chest with 3:29 left and was quick to cover the rebound in front. Then with Luukkonen pulled for the extra attacker, Gustavsson stopped Thompson from the top of the slot with 50 seconds left.

“I think \[in the\] last minute there we had five or six chances where he was post to post with his legs making sprawled-out saves, and we were just jamming away,” Thompson said. “So they did a good job tonight. We knew coming in they’re a team that doesn’t give up much, and I thought we got a lot of Grade-A looks. We’ve just got to convert those into goals.”

The Sabres were coming off four straight on the road, going 3-1-0.

“I think we’re growing as a team,” Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff said. “I think we understand that you really don’t need to change the way you’re playing. You’ve just got to stay with it. We did it on the road trip. We talked about that after the second period -- we’re going to get our looks, we have to take advantage. It might be a screen goal, tip goal, ugly goal. Kind of like the Anaheim goal that got us going (in a 3-2 overtime win Friday) where it slipped behind the goaltender. I think that’s the part I’m most impressed with. We’ve been able to play a pretty consistent style.”

**NOTES:** Minnesota is 6-0-2 in its past eight road games and tied the Vancouver Canucks (8-0-0 from Oct. 17-Nov. 26) for the longest road point streak by a team this season. … Kaprizov has a 12-game road point streak (nine goals, 16 assists). … Wild defenseman <forge-entity title="Jonas Brodin" slug="jonas-brodin-8476463" code="player">Jonas Brodin</forge-entity> was a late scratch because of an upper-body injury. There was no update. … Thompson played 19:43 and had six shots on goal after missing the previous five games with a lower-body injury.

**New Jersey Devils 0 - 3 St Louis Blues**  
Binnington stops 31, sets Blues wins record with shutout of Devils
 <forge-entity title="Jordan Binnington" slug="jordan-binnington-8476412" code="player">Jordan Binnington</forge-entity> made 31 saves and set the St. Louis Blues’ franchise record for wins with a 3-0 victory against the New Jersey Devils at Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey, on Wednesday. 
Binnington earned his 152nd win in his 298th NHL game, passing Mike Liut, who had 151 wins in 347 games.

"It's nice just to get it and to accomplish something like that," Binnington said. "It's just a matter of being here long enough to get those wins and to compound those wins over time. I'm proud to be here and I'm proud to have that many wins."

The shutout was Binnington’s first of the season and 16th in the NHL. His first NHL win was also a shutout, 3-0 against the Philadelphia Flyers on Jan. 7, 2019.

<forge-entity title="Dylan Holloway" slug="dylan-holloway-8482077" code="player">Dylan Holloway</forge-entity> scored twice in the first period, and <forge-entity title="Robert Thomas" slug="robert-thomas-8480023" code="player">Robert Thomas</forge-entity> also scored for the Blues (11-12-1), who have won two in a row since Jim Montgomery took over as coach on Sunday. They defeated the New York Rangers 5-2 on Monday in Montgomery's debut.

"I really liked our first, I really liked our third, our D-zone coverage and our neutral-zone coverage in the third period shows me signs of we're going to be a good checking team over time," Montgomery said. "The third period, the D-zone coverage was excellent. We kept it to the outside. In the second period, 'Binner,' congratulations on breaking records, and he showed why in the second period because he was fantastic." 
<forge-entity title="Jacob Markstrom" slug="jacob-markstrom-8474593" code="player">Jacob Markstrom</forge-entity> made 16 saves for the Devils (15-8-2), who had won three in a row and eight of 10. New Jersey played without forward <forge-entity title="Timo Meier" slug="timo-meier-8478414" code="player">Timo Meier</forge-entity>, who was suspended one game for cross-checking Nashville Predators forward <forge-entity title="Zachary L&#39;Heureux" slug="zachary-l-heureux-8482742" code="player">Zachary L&#39;Heureux</forge-entity> during a 5-2 win on Monday.

"We weren't ready to play," Devils coach Sheldon Keefe said. "You spot them leads like that, they got what they needed out of the game and they're parking the bus, clogging it up and making it hard to get to their net. They're not taking any chances on offense, so the game doesn't really open up for you at all. You've just got to find your way through that, and it was clearly a struggle for us."

Thomas scored nine seconds in to give the Blues a 1-0 lead on a one-timer from the left circle off a pass by <forge-entity title="Pavel Buchnevich" slug="pavel-buchnevich-8477402" code="player">Pavel Buchnevich</forge-entity>. He tied the St. Louis record for the second-fastest goal scored to start a game.

"We obviously started great, came with tons of energy," Blues captain <forge-entity title="Brayden Schenn" slug="brayden-schenn-8475170" code="player">Brayden Schenn</forge-entity> said. "Tons of emotion early and got rewarded for it. We surprised them a little bit. They're a great team over there with tons of speed." 
Holloway made it 2-0 at 6:23, three seconds after a Blues power play expired, with a wrist shot from the right circle.

Holloway extended it to 3-0 at 16:05 from the slot, chopping at a loose puck off <forge-entity title="Colton Parayko" slug="colton-parayko-8476892" code="player">Colton Parayko</forge-entity>'s one-timer from the left point. It was the first time this season St. Louis has scored three goals in the first period.

Holloway has four points (two goals, two assists) the past two games.

"Sometimes things click. I'm just going to keep working like I always do," Holloway said. "I'm feeling good about my game right now. I'm trying to stay confident, but at the same time, I have to have a short memory. You never want to get too high or too low."

The Devils outshot the Blues 24-10 over the final two periods, including 11-1 in the second, but couldn't solve Binnington.

"It was pressure but couldn't find a way to get one," New Jersey forward <forge-entity title="Stefan Noesen" slug="stefan-noesen-8476474" code="player">Stefan Noesen</forge-entity> said. "Probably just not hard enough in those areas. ... When things aren't going the way you want, you've got to find other ways to score."

Said Montgomery of Binnington: “(He) held down the fort (in the second period) while we were struggling. But the positive out of that is, it was very obvious where we needed to get better and what we needed to continue to do well."

Buchnevich left at 7:06 of the second period favoring his right leg and did not return.

Montgomery had no update after the game, saying, "I think it's day to day, but I don't have anything."

**NOTES:** Along with Thomas, Rob Ramage (Jan. 24, 1987) and Andy McDonald (Nov. 11, 2010) also scored in nine seconds to start the game for the Blues. Greg Paslawski (Oct. 29, 1985) and Alexander Steen (March 16, 2010) hold the record of eight seconds. … New Jersey was shut out for the fourth time this season and second time in the past four home games.

**Detroit Red Wings 2 - 1 Calgary Flames**  
Lucas Raymond propelled the Detroit Red Wings to a 2-1 victory over the Calgary Flames with a power-play goal at 3:35 in overtime. This marked Raymond's fourth consecutive game scoring, adding his sixth goal of the season and extending his points streak to five games. Alex DeBrincat, who also scored for Detroit, assisted on the game-winning goal. The Red Wings, who have now claimed victory in three of their last four games, benefitted from solid goaltending by Cam Talbot, who made 24 saves. The Flames, despite Connor Zary's power-play equalizer and 25 saves from Dan Vladar, have now lost two consecutive games following a previous four-game winning streak. Both teams showed resilience, with all regulation goals coming from special teams play and no scoring occurring during 5-on-5. The decisive moment in the game was Calgary being penalized for too many men on the ice during overtime, leading to Raymond's clinching goal for Detroit.

**Tampa Bay Lightning 4 - 5 Washington Capitals**  
The Washington Capitals staged a dramatic comeback to defeat the Tampa Bay Lightning 5-4 at Amalie Arena, overcoming a blunder by their goalie, Charlie Lindgren, who accidentally scored an own goal. Tom Wilson emerged as the hero, breaking a 4-4 tie with just over three minutes left, redirecting a shot during a power play after Anthony Cirelli was penalized for high sticking. Brayden Point proved formidable for the Lightning, completing a hat trick and briefly giving them a 4-3 lead following Lindgren's mishap. John Carlson leveled the score for the Capitals before Wilson's game-winning goal. Despite Lindgren's error, he was buoyed by his teammates' support and made 25 saves. Meanwhile, Dylan Strome and Aliaksei Protas each contributed a goal and an assist for the Capitals. The Lightning, supported by solid goaltending from Andrei Vasilevskiy with 27 saves, suffered their third loss in four games.

**Florida Panthers 5 - 1 Toronto Maple Leafs**  
The Florida Panthers snapped a four-game losing streak with a decisive 5-1 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs at Amerant Bank Arena, highlighting Carter Verhaeghe's standout performance with a goal and two assists. Aleksander Barkov and Sam Bennett each contributed a goal and an assist, while Sergei Bobrovsky made 23 saves to bolster the Panthers' win. The Panthers, having struggled recently with six losses in seven games, refocused their approach, as emphasized by Coach Paul Maurice's comments on their priorities and identity. Mitch Marner scored the sole goal for Toronto, who was previously on a strong streak with four consecutive wins. Special teams were a defining factor, with Florida capitalizing on power plays and a short-handed goal, despite injuries impacting both teams' lineups. Toronto's Anthony Stolarz, facing his former team for the first time since a Stanley Cup victory, was unable to match Bobrovsky's performance, and key penalties against Toronto late in the game widened the scoring gap. Additionally, the game featured notable former Panthers now with Toronto, including Mitch Marner's ongoing point streak and Sam Reinhart's rise to lead the NHL in goals with his 17th of the season.

Behind two goals from Brad Marchand and three assists from David Pastrnak, the Bruins bounced back from a previous loss to the Vancouver Canucks. Despite defensive lapses, which Boston's coach Joe Sacco noted, they managed a vital win against a determined Islanders squad. The Islanders' Brock Nelson kept pace with a pair of goals and an assist, while Maxim Tsyplakov contributed a goal and an assist. Islanders' coach Patrick Roy highlighted his team's improved play, though they faltered at crucial moments, leading to a 1-4-1 slump. Notably, Nikita Zadorov sealed the game with an empty-net goal, while Marchand's first multigoal game since January provided early momentum.

The Pittsburgh Penguins snapped a three-game losing streak with a nail-biting 5-4 victory over the Vancouver Canucks at PPG Paints Arena. Bryan Rust led the Penguins with two goals and an assist, while Erik Karlsson contributed three assists and Sidney Crosby added two. Despite a strong first period where Pittsburgh capitalized on four of ten shots to establish a 4-1 lead, the Canucks surged back with Quinn Hughes and Elias Pettersson leading a spirited comeback attempt. Tristan Jarry made 25 crucial saves to secure his first win since October 14 and first home victory since March 14. Notably, it marked Rust’s 25th multi-goal game, placing him fourth in franchise history since 2014-15. Meanwhile, Penguins newcomer Philip Tomasino debuted after his acquisition from the Nashville Predators. Vancouver's Max Sasson continued his impressive start by registering an assist, becoming the first Canucks player to record points in his first two career games since Pettersson.

Nick Suzuki scored 42 seconds into overtime, giving the Montreal Canadiens a 4-3 win against the Columbus Blue Jackets, extending their winning streak against Columbus to seven games. Suzuki capitalized on his own rebound for the decisive goal, highlighting a game where Montreal completed the second half of a back-to-back with a resilient performance. Juraj Slafkovsky ended a 14-game goal drought and contributed with a goal and assist, while Cayden Primeau stopped 21 shots for the Canadiens. In contrast, the Blue Jackets were unable to secure a fourth consecutive win despite Zach Werenski extending his point streak to six games. Elvis Merzlikins made 19 saves, but Columbus couldn't replicate their previous overtime and shootout victories. Notably, Werenski tied Bryan Berard's franchise record for the longest point streak by a Blue Jackets defenseman. Despite their efforts, Montreal's pace proved too much for Columbus, who had been seeking consistency in their play according to coach Dean Evason.

**Nashville Predators 2 - 3 Philadelphia Flyers**  
In a thrilling matchup, the Philadelphia Flyers clinched a 3-2 victory over the Nashville Predators with Sean Couturier scoring the decisive goal 2:31 into overtime after Morgan Frost had tied the game at 2-2 with just 11.4 seconds left in regulation. Couturier also assisted in Frost's equalizer, continuing his contribution to the Flyers' win. Despite not playing their sharpest game, Flyers goalie Aleksei Kolosov provided crucial support, making 25 saves. For the Predators, Roman Josi and Ryan O'Reilly each found the back of the net, with O'Reilly’s goal marking his first since late October. Josi opened the scoring in the first period, while Frost's timely redirection of a shot from Couturier symbolized the Flyers' resilience and ability to capitalize on late opportunities. Nashville's coach Andrew Brunette expressed disappointment over the team's missed chances to maintain their lead, highlighting crucial mistakes through the neutral zone. The game also marked defenseman Adam Wilsby's NHL debut for the Predators.

**Chicago Blackhawks 6 - 2 Dallas Stars**  
In a thrilling game at the United Center, Taylor Hall achieved his first hat trick in over a decade, powering the Chicago Blackhawks to a 6-2 victory over the Dallas Stars. Hall's hat trick, his first since December 2013, made him the fifth player in NHL history to go ten years between hat tricks. He scored the game's opening goal just 17 seconds in, setting a record for the Blackhawks since 2020. Rookie Connor Bedard broke a 12-game goal drought with a power-play tally, and Louis Crevier netted his first NHL goal. The Blackhawks, overcoming recent struggles, snapped a losing streak, while the Stars faced a second consecutive loss, with coach Pete DeBoer noting poor performance in crucial periods. Dallas' Matt Duchene scored on a power play, but it wasn't enough to turn the tide against Chicago's dominant display.

The Los Angeles Kings secured a 4-1 victory over the Winnipeg Jets at Crypto.com Arena, with Anze Kopitar and Adrian Kempe each contributing a goal and an assist. The Kings halted the Jets’ recent momentum, as Winnipeg had experienced a seven-game winning streak prior to going 3-4-0.

For Winnipeg, Gabriel Vilardi managed a power-play goal, and Connor Hellebuyck faced a barrage of shots, making 29 saves.

The Ducks, now 9-9-3, got a boost from Trevor Zegras, Cutter Gauthier, and Alex Killorn, who each contributed a goal and an assist. Anaheim avenged their 3-2 loss from Monday’s home clash with Seattle by capitalizing on key opportunities. Frank Vatrano and Brett Leason initially put the Ducks ahead, but Seattle's Oliver Bjorkstrand and Eeli Tolvanen managed to equalize the game at 2-2. Anaheim quickly regained the lead through Killorn's goal after a turnover by Kraken's defenseman Adam Larsson. Gauthier's late power-play goal and Zegras's nifty finish secured the win. Despite Joey Daccord's effort with 28 saves, Seattle (11-11-1) dropped two of their last three games.
