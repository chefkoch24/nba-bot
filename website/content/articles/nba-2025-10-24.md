**Golden State Warriors 137 - 131 Denver Nuggets**  
In a thrilling overtime victory, the Golden State Warriors overcame the Los Angeles Lakers 119-109, with a standout performance by Jimmy Butler, who scored 31 points, and an unexpected contribution from Jonathan Kuminga, who matched his career-best by hitting four 3-pointers and adding 17 points, nine rebounds, and six assists. Kuminga, filling in for the injured Moses Moody, proved pivotal against a Lakers team missing LeBron James. The Warriors' victory sets the stage for their upcoming matchup against the Denver Nuggets, whose star player, Nikola Jokic, is noted for triple-double performances on opening nights. The anticipated duel between Jokic and Stephen Curry marks their 29th regular-season clash, with both players historically capable of scoring over 30 points in these encounters. The Nuggets, aiming to bridge the gap with leading teams, have bolstered their roster by acquiring Cameron Johnson, complementing Jokic's playmaking expertise.
