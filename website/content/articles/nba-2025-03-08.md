**Charlotte Hornets 117 - 118 Cleveland Cavaliers**  
The Cleveland Cavaliers edged out the Charlotte Hornets in a thrilling 118-117 victory in Charlotte, extending their winning streak to 13 games. Donovan Mitchell led the Cavaliers with 24 points, ably supported by Darius Garland's 20 points and Evan Mobley's 19. Despite Cleveland's strong start, leading by 13 points early in the second half, Charlotte fought back to take a 104-95 lead late in the game. However, Cleveland responded with a 25-15 run, securing victory with De’Andre Hunter's decisive basket and defensive play that forced a turnover. Charlotte's Miles Bridges was a standout performer, scoring 46 points, but couldn't convert a last-second shot from halfcourt. The Cavaliers, who now boast a league-best 53-10 record and have achieved three winning streaks of 12 or more games this season, will face the Milwaukee Bucks next, while the Hornets, now at a nine-game losing streak, host the Brooklyn Nets.

**Toronto Raptors 118 - 109 Utah Jazz**  
Immanuel Quickley's season-high 34 points led the Toronto Raptors to a 118-109 victory over the Utah Jazz, marking Toronto's third consecutive win. Despite Walker Kessler's impressive performance for Utah, with career highs of 25 rebounds and eight blocks along with 18 points, the Jazz suffered their fourth straight loss, highlighting their ongoing struggles in the Western Conference. Scottie Barnes contributed significantly for Toronto with 22 points, 12 rebounds, and six assists. The Raptors managed to triumph despite missing key players, including rookie Ja'Kobe Walter, who left the game injured. Utah struggled with poor free-throw shooting and committed 25 turnovers, hindering their comeback efforts. Quickley's crucial back-to-back 3-pointers in the final minutes solidified Toronto's lead. The Raptors aim to maintain their momentum as they continue a four-game homestand, facing Washington next, while the Jazz travel to Philadelphia for their upcoming game.

Meanwhile, Brandon Williams scored a career-high 31 points for the Mavericks, who suffered their fourth consecutive loss. Dallas, struggling without the injured Kyrie Irving, managed just one field goal in the final seven minutes. Memphis, currently fourth in the Western Conference, dominated in the paint with a 74-38 advantage over the Mavericks, who are now at .500 for the first time since mid-November.

**Miami Heat 104 - 106 Minnesota Timberwolves**  
The Minnesota Timberwolves secured their fourth consecutive victory by narrowly defeating the Miami Heat 106-104, showcasing a balanced team effort with seven players scoring in double figures. Mike Conley, Naz Reid, and Donte DiVincenzo each contributed 15 points, while Anthony Edwards, who typically averages 27.5 points per game, was limited to just 10 shot attempts, ending with 13 points. The game came down to the wire as Nickeil Alexander-Walker added 12 points, and Edwards split a pair of free throws in the final seconds to give Minnesota a five-point lead before a late Duncan Robinson 3-pointer brought Miami within two. In a dramatic finish, Conley's errant inbounds pass gave Miami a last-second opportunity, but Bam Adebayo's 3-pointer rimmed out, leaving him with 29 points and 13 rebounds for the game. This victory helped the Timberwolves avoid a season sweep by the Heat for the first time since the 2016-17 season. Miami began their five-game homestand with this tightly contested loss and looks forward to facing Chicago next, while Minnesota will host San Antonio.

**Oklahoma City Thunder 107 - 89 Portland Trail Blazers**  
The Oklahoma City Thunder secured a 107-89 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers, marking their sixth consecutive win, even with MVP candidate Shai Gilgeous-Alexander resting and notable absences like Chet Holmgren and Isaiah Hartenstein due to injuries. Aaron Wiggins led with 30 points, while Jaylin Williams recorded his first career triple-double with 10 points, 11 rebounds, and 11 assists. Despite the Blazers closing in to within two points in the fourth quarter, clutch 3-pointers by Williams and Wiggins helped the Thunder pull away. Oklahoma City's defense was formidable, holding an opponent under 90 points for the first time since November. On the opposing side, Scoot Henderson led the Blazers with 22 points, and Jerami Grant returned to action after missing four games. The Thunder look to extend their winning streak as their homestand continues with back-to-back games against Denver.

**Denver Nuggets 149 - 141 Phoenix Suns**  
In a crucial game for playoff positioning, the Phoenix Suns edged past the Denver Nuggets with an impressive rally, overcoming a 23-point deficit against the Los Angeles Clippers earlier. Despite heated exchanges between Kevin Durant and coach Mike Budenholzer, Durant emphasized their shared commitment to team success. Durant was vital with 34 points, leading Phoenix with 26.9 points per game this season. The Nuggets face adversity with injuries, including Julian Strawther's extended absence and Aaron Gordon's recent games missed. However, Peyton Watson returned after injury, contributing defensively with a team-leading 1.2 blocks per game. Denver's Russell Westbrook stepped up in Gordon's absence, scoring 25 points. Highlighting the game, Nikola Jokic made history with the first-ever 30-20-20 game, maintaining his position as a powerhouse in scoring, rebounds, and assists this season.

**Sacramento Kings 127 - 109 San Antonio Spurs**  
In a tightly contested game, the Sacramento Kings lost 116-110 to the Denver Nuggets, squandering a nine-point lead entering the final quarter, despite significant contributions from DeMar DeRozan, Zach Levine, and Jonas Valanciunas. The Kings, currently ninth in the Western Conference, are eager to improve their standing and are navigating challenges including injuries to key players like Domantas Sabonis and Malik Monk. Meanwhile, the San Antonio Spurs, sitting 13th in the conference, are finishing the season without their star center, Victor Wembanyama, yet are buoyed by their recent 127-113 victory over Brooklyn, where Devin Vassell shone with a career-high 37 points. Noteworthy is De'Aaron Fox's return to Sacramento, following his trade to the Spurs, where he has embraced his new role despite a dislocated finger that may require surgery in the offseason.

**LA Clippers 105 - 95 New York Knicks**  
The Los Angeles Clippers aim to capitalize on James Harden's stellar performance as they prepare to face the New York Knicks in Inglewood, California. Harden scored a season-high 50 points in a win against the Detroit Pistons, marking the eighth time a Clippers player has achieved such a feat, while only five players, including Bob McAdoo, have reached this milestone in franchise history. The Clippers, affected by injuries to key players like Kawhi Leonard and Norman Powell, and an extensive road trip, regained confidence with the victory. New acquisition Bogdan Bogdanovic contributed 23 points alongside Ivica Zubac's 22 points and 11 rebounds. The Knicks, coming off a 113-109 overtime loss to the Lakers, face uncertainty with leading scorer Jalen Brunson likely out due to an ankle injury sustained in that game. New York failed to defend a 10-point lead, scoring just 15 points in the fourth quarter, and has now lost consecutive games for the second time in recent contests. Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau emphasized the impact of late-game toughness and loose ball situations, while the team looks for a replacement for Brunson's production.
