**Boston Celtics 116 - 117 Atlanta Hawks**  
In a thrilling NBA Cup opener, the Atlanta Hawks staged an impressive comeback to edge out the Boston Celtics 117-116 after overcoming a 15-point, second-half deficit. With star player Trae Young sidelined due to tendinitis, Onyeka Okongwu's crucial tip-in with 6.1 seconds remaining secured the win, as Jaylen Brown's buzzer-beater attempt missed. Dyson Daniels stood out with a career-high 28 points, and Jalen Johnson achieved a triple-double. Despite Jaylen Brown scoring a season-high 37 points and Derrick White adding 31 for the Celtics, Boston's two-game winning streak was halted, marking only their third loss of the season. Notably, Jayson Tatum surpassed Tommy Heinsohn for 12th place on the Celtics' all-time scoring list. The Hawks will face the Washington Wizards next in the NBA Cup, while the Celtics are set to play the Brooklyn Nets.

**Detroit Pistons 123 - 121 Miami Heat**  
In a dramatic NBA Cup game, the Detroit Pistons narrowly defeated the Miami Heat 123-121 in overtime, thanks to a crucial tiebreaking free throw by Malik Beasley with 1.1 seconds remaining. The game took a surprising turn after Miami was penalized with a technical foul for calling an illegal timeout.

Beasley capitalized on the Heat's mistake to secure the win with two free throws. Herro delivered an impressive performance, scoring 40 points, including 20 in the fourth quarter and overtime. The game also saw significant injuries, with Nikola Jovic leaving early due to a collision and Tim Hardaway Jr. being wheeled off after an injury in the third quarter. Despite leading early, the Pistons had to fight off a strong comeback by the Heat, marked by a 23-4 Miami run powered by Herro, Bam Adebayo, and Duncan Robinson.

Early in the game, Jalen Suggs showed efficiency by making his first seven shots, including three 3-pointers, and finished with 17 points and two steals. Despite sharp shooting from Ball, the Hornets struggled with turnovers, notably in the second quarter, allowing the Magic to dominate with a 19-3 run. The Magic showcased strong bench contributions with a 45-27 edge and improved defensive performance in this third consecutive home win, despite playing without key injured players Paolo Banchero and Wendell Carter Jr. The Magic's triumph marked another defensive stand in their recent streak, demonstrating their resilience and depth.

**Philadelphia 76ers 99 - 111 New York Knicks**  
In the Knicks' victory over the Philadelphia 76ers, OG Anunoby led New York with 24 points as they defeated the Sixers 111-99, spoiling Joel Embiid's season debut. Embiid, appearing rusty after returning from his last game at the Paris Olympics, managed only 13 points in 26 minutes and struggled with shooting and defense, contributing to Philadelphia's 2-8 record. Despite Paul George's 29 points and 10 rebounds for the Sixers, the Knicks showcased a balanced offense with six players scoring in double figures, including Josh Hart, who had a triple-double with 14 points, 12 rebounds, and 10 assists. New York's decisive 13-2 run at the start of the fourth quarter, marked by Anunoby's three dunks, emphasized Embiid's defensive lapses. The Knicks' strong ball movement resulted in 31 assists on 44 field goals, with a 49% shooting accuracy. New York is set to play Chicago next, while the 76ers will face undefeated Cleveland.

**Milwaukee Bucks 99 - 85 Toronto Raptors**  
In a matchup between the NBA's bottom two teams, Giannis Antetokounmpo propelled the Milwaukee Bucks to a 99-85 victory over the Toronto Raptors. Antetokounmpo contributed 23 points, with substantial support from Bobby Portis, who scored 17 points off the bench. The Bucks, now 3-8, managed to widen their lead significantly in the third quarter and maintained it despite a late Raptors surge. Gradey Dick delivered an impressive performance for Toronto, notching a career-high 32 points, but it wasn't enough to prevent the Raptors from dropping their fifth consecutive game. Notable absences included the Bucks' Damian Lillard, who is in concussion protocol, and the Raptors' Immanuel Quickley due to an elbow injury. Milwaukee's strategy saw them take 31 three-point attempts by halftime, reflecting Toronto's defensive focus on Antetokounmpo.

In an impressive display, Devin Booker and Bradley Beal led the Phoenix Suns to a 120-112 victory over the Utah Jazz in their NBA Cup pool play opener. Booker scored 31 points, while Beal added 24, and together with Grayson Allen, they hit 13 three-pointers, anchoring the Suns' potent offense. Despite the Jazz's efforts, with John Collins achieving 29 points and 10 rebounds and notable contributions from reserves like Kyle Filipowski, Utah struggled to overcome a persistent double-digit deficit. A critical moment involved Lauri Markkanen inadvertently tipping the ball into Phoenix's basket, sparking a 12-0 Suns run. Phoenix excelled on fast breaks, scoring 16 points off transitions, while Utah dominated the paint with a 58-34 edge. The Suns' efficient shooting, especially from beyond the arc, kept the Jazz at bay, securing their win despite Utah's various rally attempts.

**Golden State Warriors 120 - 117 Dallas Mavericks**  
Klay Thompson's return to San Francisco with the Dallas Mavericks added extra excitement to the NBA Cup matchup against his former team, the Golden State Warriors. After a successful 13-year tenure with the Warriors, which included four championships and ranking second behind Stephen Curry in career 3-pointers, Thompson moved to the Mavericks in a sign-and-trade. Despite Thompson's efforts to deemphasize the homecoming and focus on winning the NBA Cup, the Warriors had a special tribute planned, although their primary focus remained on the game ahead. The Warriors, with an 8-2 record, aimed to maintain momentum, while Kyrie Irving highlighted the Mavericks' narrow loss to the Denver Nuggets with a 43-point performance. The game emphasized both the camaraderie and competitive spirit fostered during Thompson's time with the Warriors.

**Portland Trail Blazers 122 - 108 Minnesota Timberwolves**  
In a matchup marked by recent team struggles and roster changes, the Minnesota Timberwolves prepared to face the Portland Trail Blazers in the NBA Cup, fresh off a disappointing 95-94 loss to the Miami Heat. This defeat ended their three-game win streak and was highlighted by Mike Conley's missed 3-pointer in the final seconds and 20 turnovers committed by the team. Coach Chris Finch admitted to confusion in the last possessions, with Rudy Gobert noting it as a collective loss despite being in a winning position. Meanwhile, the Blazers endured a demoralizing 134-89 defeat to a shorthanded Memphis Grizzlies squad, prompting coach Chauncey Billups to label his team's effort as "embarrassing." Jerami Grant led Portland with 20 points, but the team shot a mere 9.5 percent from beyond the arc and committed 23 turnovers, with Shaedon Sharpe contributing 7 points in his first season start. Both teams are navigating the complexities of integrating new players, with Minnesota trading Karl-Anthony Towns for Julius Randle and Donte DiVincenzo. Amid these transitions, the Timberwolves aim to extend their winning streak against the beleaguered Blazers, whom they've bested in their last five encounters.
