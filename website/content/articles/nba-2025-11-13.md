**Charlotte Hornets 111 - 100 Milwaukee Bucks**  
The Charlotte Hornets, led by Ryan Kalkbrenner's perfect 8-for-8 shooting and 17 points, managed to break a three-game losing streak with a 111-100 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks. Despite Miles Bridges' 20 points and solid contributions from Collin Sexton and Kon Knueppel, it was Kalkbrenner's flawless performance that stood out. The Bucks, playing without the two-time NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo due to a knee issue, saw Ryan Rollins score 25 points, including four 3-pointers. Notably, the Hornets dominated from the free-throw line, making 23 of their 27 attempts compared to the Bucks' 8 of 13, and also had a significant rebounding advantage of 50-34. Kyle Kuzma, who was in good form recently, could only manage eight points for the Bucks. Both Giannis and LaMelo Ball missed the game due to injuries, but Giannis is expected back for the next matchup between these teams in Milwaukee.

**Detroit Pistons 124 - 113 Chicago Bulls**  
The Detroit Pistons, led by Paul Reed's 28 points and 13 rebounds, secured their eighth consecutive victory by defeating the Chicago Bulls 124-113, even while missing their entire usual starting lineup and two key reserves.

**Oklahoma City Thunder 121 - 92 Los Angeles Lakers**  
The Los Angeles Lakers, navigating the season sans LeBron James, are finding strength in the backcourt duo of Luka Doncic and Austin Reaves, who, when healthy, rank among the NBA's best. The pair, available for just five games as of late, combined for 62 points in a recent win against Charlotte, showcasing their dynamic synergy. Lakers coach JJ Redick praised Reaves as an "All-Star level player," highlighting the duo's impact on the team's depth and performance, especially since the Lakers lead the league in shooting at 51.2%. Meanwhile, the Oklahoma City Thunder, boasting an impressive 12-1 record, are also making headlines, with rookie Chet Holmgren delivering a perfect shooting performance and illustrating significant growth under coach Mark Daigneault's guidance. Thunder's defensive prowess, limiting opponents to 42.1% shooting, and reigning MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's strong performances have contributed to the team's success. As the two teams meet, the matchup promises to test the Lakers against the league's top team, despite injury concerns on both sides, including Luguentz Dort's absence for the Thunder and Lakers rookie Adou Thiero yet to debut.

**Sacramento Kings 100 - 133 Atlanta Hawks**  
In a challenging season for the Sacramento Kings, the team suffered a 122-108 defeat to the Denver Nuggets, with Sacramento's struggles highlighted by a dismal fourth-quarter performance and a 16-2 Denver run. Coach Doug Christie expressed frustration, suggesting potential lineup changes involving Russell Westbrook and Dennis Schroder, as the latter has struggled significantly in recent games. Meanwhile, the Atlanta Hawks, buoyed by Vit Krejci's career-high 28 points and eight 3-pointers, edged out the Los Angeles Clippers 105-102, overcoming a 17-point deficit. Krejci's heroics have been instrumental following assurances of more playing time from coach Quin Snyder.

**LA Clippers 116 - 130 Denver Nuggets**  
Nikola Jokić's 35-point performance, along with his 15 rebounds and seven assists, powered the Denver Nuggets to a 122-108 victory over the Sacramento Kings, bolstering their five-game winning streak as they prepare to face the Los Angeles Clippers in a challenging road matchup. Despite their perfect 6-0 record at home, the Nuggets have been less consistent away, sitting at 2-2, and seek to improve this on their current road stretch. Jokić's efforts were complemented by the return of Aaron Gordon and Jamal Murray, who contributed significantly after resting earlier. Meanwhile, the Clippers face challenges of their own, being on a five-game losing streak and grappling with injury setbacks, including the absences of Kawhi Leonard and Bradley Beal. In their recent 105-102 loss to the Atlanta Hawks, James Harden stepped up with 35 points, 10 rebounds, and 11 assists for his seventh triple-double as a Clipper, tying the franchise record. Despite Harden's fourth-quarter surge, the Clippers need better execution and defensive stops, areas emphasized by both Harden and Ivica Zubac.
