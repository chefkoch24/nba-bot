**New York Giants 7 - 30 Tampa Bay Buccaneers**  
In a dominant performance, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers defeated the New York Giants 30-7, with quarterback Baker Mayfield leading the charge both on and off the field. Mayfield, who threw for 294 yards and added a spectacular 10-yard touchdown run, cheekily mocked Giants' quarterback Tommy DeVito by imitating his signature celebratory dance. The win snapped Tampa Bay's four-game losing streak and extended New York's skid to six games. The Buccaneers, who scored on five of their first six possessions, saw Bucky Irving and Sean Tucker contribute to their four rushing touchdowns, while Mike Evans returned to action, catching five passes for 68 yards. The Giants, unable to find their rhythm, struggled offensively, with DeVito throwing for 189 yards and being sacked four times. The game also saw key players from both sides suffer injuries, but Mayfield hopes this victory paves the way for a more confident team going forward.

**Carolina Panthers 27 - 30 Kansas City Chiefs**  
In a thrilling game that saw the Kansas City Chiefs secure a last-second victory over the Carolina Panthers 30-27, Patrick Mahomes orchestrated a remarkable final drive, setting up Spencer Schrader's 31-yard game-winning field goal.

This marked the 21st career game-winning drive for Mahomes, with the Chiefs now having won five games this season decided in the dying seconds. Noah Gray was instrumental with two touchdown receptions, while DeAndre Hopkins added another score as the Chiefs improved to 10-1. Despite a strong comeback effort led by Bryce Young, who threw for 262 yards and a touchdown for the Panthers, the home team fell short. Kansas City's Travis Kelce climbed to third place in career receiving yards by a tight end, although he didn't score a touchdown for the ninth time this season. Both teams faced challenges, with the Panthers struggling in the red zone and the Chiefs committing nine penalties. The victory keeps the Chiefs at the top of their division as they prepare to host the Las Vegas Raiders next.

**Las Vegas Raiders 19 - 29 Denver Broncos**  
In a triumphant win for the Denver Broncos, rookie quarterback Bo Nix set a new team record with two touchdown passes, surpassing Marlin Briscoe's 1968 rookie record, as Denver secured a 29-19 victory over the struggling Las Vegas Raiders. The game marked Denver's first road win against the Raiders since 2015 and highlighted their improved playoff prospects with a 7-5 record. Nix, who completed 25 of 42 passes for 273 yards, connected twice with Courtland Sutton, whose performance extended his 70-yard game streak to five, the longest for a Broncos player since 2014. Las Vegas, now 2-9, suffered its seventh straight loss, compounded by injury woes and strategic challenges, including Gardner Minshew's season-ending collarbone injury. Despite a resilient first half and standout plays like AJ Cole's 34-yard fake punt pass, the Raiders couldn't maintain momentum. The match also featured a field goal duel between kickers Daniel Carlson and Will Lutz, who combined for a perfect nine attempts, and saw Maxx Crosby notch his 100th tackle for loss, joining elite company in NFL history.

**Washington Commanders 26 - 34 Dallas Cowboys**  
In a turbulent game that saw a chaotic fourth-quarter finish, the Dallas Cowboys defeated the Washington Commanders 34-26, marking the Commanders' third consecutive loss. The final four minutes were particularly dramatic, with the teams combining for 31 points, the second-highest in an NFL game since at least 2000. Despite Washington scoring a potential game-tying touchdown with just 21 seconds left, kicker Austin Seibert missed the crucial extra point, while errors and missed opportunities, such as a costly fumble by John Bates, plagued the Commanders. Dallas capitalized with strong performances from QB Cooper Rush and special teams, including a 99-yard kickoff return touchdown by KaVonte Turpin. The game's chaotic nature was underscored by it being the first in the Super Bowl era to feature two missed extra points, two kickoff return touchdowns, and a blocked punt. While the Cowboys ended their five-game losing streak, Washington, favored by 10.5 points, was left to assess the emotional and strategic fallout of their defeat.

**Green Bay Packers 38 - 10 San Francisco 49ers**  
In a dominating performance, the Green Bay Packers defeated a depleted San Francisco 49ers team 38-10, fueled by Josh Jacobs' three rushing touchdowns and 106-yard effort, marking the first time in 55 games the 49ers allowed a 100-yard rusher. Green Bay capitalized on the 49ers' three turnovers and nine penalties, establishing a 24-7 lead by the third quarter. With key players like Brock Purdy, Trent Williams, and Nick Bosa sidelined, the 49ers, led by Brandon Allen in his 10th career start, struggled offensively and defensively. Despite a late second-quarter touchdown by George Kittle, the 49ers failed to close the gap further, hindered by penalties that nullified significant gains. Packers' new additions, including Jacobs and Xavier McKinney, played crucial roles, with McKinney contributing a key interception and a pass breakup. Green Bay raised their record to 8-3, finding momentum with strong performances from quarterback Jordan Love and a well-rounded team effort.

**Seattle Seahawks 16 - 6 Arizona Cardinals**  
In a dominant defensive performance, the Seattle Seahawks overcame the Arizona Cardinals 16-6, propelled by Coby Bryant's exhilarating 69-yard interception return for a touchdown and Leonard Williams' impactful 2.5 sacks. Williams' defensive prowess was critical in stifling Arizona's offense, as the Seahawks limited the Cardinals to 298 total yards and just 49 rushing yards, ending Arizona's four-game winning streak and tying Seattle for the NFC West lead. The Seahawks' defense was instrumental, with their standout showing marking the first time the Cardinals had allowed an offensive touchdown since facing Miami three weeks prior. Despite Geno Smith's interception, he contributed a key 254 passing yards and a touchdown. Jaxon Smith-Njigba notched the first offensive touchdown against Arizona in weeks, while the Cardinals' Kyler Murray, hindered by the Seahawksâ€™ relentless defense, struggled to spark his team despite a solid 285-yard passing effort. This victory came as Seattle battled not just Arizona but also recent storm disruptions, marking their best defensive display under new coach Mike Macdonald.

Barkley's explosive plays bookended a dominant second half where Philadelphia scored 24 points, maintaining their top spot in the NFC East with a 9-2 record. Meanwhile, the Rams, who suffered their second straight home defeat, struggled to contain Philadelphia's offense and were unable to compete with their surging plays, falling to a 5-6 record.

**Miami Dolphins 34 - 15 New England Patriots**  
Tua Tagovailoa led the Miami Dolphins to a decisive 34-15 victory over the New England Patriots, marking their third consecutive win. Tagovailoa threw for 317 yards and four touchdowns, maintaining his undefeated streak against New England and showcasing a high completion rate. The Dolphins' offense was bolstered by Jaylen Waddle's eight receptions for 144 yards and a touchdown, as well as two touchdowns from De'Von Achane. Miami's defense was pivotal, intercepting rookie quarterback Drake Maye and keeping the Patriots scoreless until the fourth quarter. Despite a brief hiccup with a fumble returned for a touchdown after Tagovailoa was briefly replaced, the Dolphins dominated, ensuring their first season sweep against the Patriots since 1999-2000. Conversely, New England's struggles continued with a lackluster offensive performance and numerous penalties, resulting in their third consecutive losing season. The Dolphins now prepare for a quick turnaround with a Thursday matchup against Green Bay.

Stroud, despite passing for 247 yards and two touchdowns, struggled with two interceptions and a crucial safety that sealed the Texans' fate.
