**Detroit Pistons 113 - 116 New York Knicks**  
The New York Knicks clinched a thrilling 116-113 victory over the Detroit Pistons, advancing to the NBA Eastern Conference semifinals for the first time since 2000. In a dazzling performance, Jalen Brunson scored 40 points, including a game-winning 3-pointer with 4.3 seconds remaining, silencing a hostile Detroit crowd. Brunson, recently honored as the NBA’s clutch player of the year, was pivotal in the Knicks' triumph, especially after Detroit erased their 11-point fourth-quarter lead. Despite a valiant 23-point effort from Detroit’s Cade Cunningham, the Pistons couldn't execute a final play, as Malik Beasley's turnover dashed hopes of forcing overtime. The Knicks, led by Mikal Bridges’ 25 points and OG Anunoby’s 22 points, now prepare to face the defending champion, Boston Celtics, in the semifinals starting Monday.

**LA Clippers 111 - 105 Denver Nuggets**  
The Denver Nuggets have regained momentum in their first-round series against the Los Angeles Clippers after initially faltering with a 34-point loss in Game 3. They now lead the series 3-2 following thrilling back-to-back victories, including a dramatic buzzer-beating dunk by Aaron Gordon in Game 4 and a masterful 43-point performance by Jamal Murray in Game 5. Murray's explosive showing, highlighted by eight 3-pointers and multiple assists, rebounds, and steals, marked his sixth postseason 40-point game, setting a franchise record. Despite Nikola Jokic’s modest scoring contribution of 13 points, he played a pivotal role with a triple-double, emphasizing Denver’s balanced attack. The Clippers, aiming to avoid a third consecutive first-round exit, leaned on strong performances from Ivica Zubac and Kawhi Leonard, though James Harden's diminished impact has been cause for concern. As they prepare to face off in Game 6, the Nuggets hope to seal the series, while the Clippers focus on sustaining the competition with Leonard emphasizing a poised, mistake-free approach.
