**Buffalo Sabres 2 - 5 Florida Panthers**  
In their third consecutive win, the Florida Panthers defeated the Buffalo Sabres 5-2, bolstered by two-point performances from team captain Aleksander Barkov, who returned after missing eight games due to a lower-body injury, and teammates Sam Reinhart, Carter Verhaeghe, and Sam Bennett. Barkov scored a goal and provided a no-look, backhand assist to Reinhart for a power-play goal. Despite a resilient effort from the Sabres, including goals from Jason Zucker and Rasmus Dahlin to tie the game in the second period, Florida pulled ahead. Sergei Bobrovsky made several key saves, notably staving off a potential Sabres lead. Jesper Boqvist's opening goal was pivotal, and the Panthers showed strong teamwork and strategic play, with Bennett extending his goal streak to five games. The Panthers head to Finland for the NHL Global Series, showcasing their strong form against the Dallas Stars.

Despite providing two assists, Stamkos couldn't lead the Predators to victory against his former team. Nick Paul netted the game-winner for Tampa Bay in overtime, assisted by Jake Guentzel, who achieved his 500th NHL point. Brayden Point contributed a goal and an assist, while Andrei Vasilevskiy made 35 saves for the Lightning, who have now won three of their last four games.

**Columbus Blue Jackets 6 - 1 Edmonton Oilers**  
In a tough game for the Edmonton Oilers, Connor McDavid suffered a lower-body injury in the first 37 seconds after being tripped by Zach Werenski, contributing to a 6-1 defeat against the Columbus Blue Jackets. Despite hopes for recovery, the Oilers missed McDavid's influence, highlighted by comments from Ryan Nugent-Hopkins about stepping up in his absence. The Blue Jackets showcased a dominant performance, with Sean Monahan scoring twice, while Cole Sillinger and Adam Fantilli made significant contributions. Columbus goaltender Elvis Merzlikins was outstanding, making 31 saves and nearly securing a shutout, only for Mattias Ekholm to score Edmonton's lone goal late in the third period. The Blue Jackets' victory marks their fourth game this season with six goals, tying them with the Vegas Golden Knights for the most such games in the NHL, while the Oilers struggled on the power play, converting just once on six opportunities.
