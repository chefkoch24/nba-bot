**Buffalo Bills 40 - 14 New York Jets**  
The Buffalo Bills secured the AFC's No. 2 seed with a decisive 40-14 victory over the struggling New York Jets, marking their fifth consecutive AFC East title and a franchise-best 13-win season. Josh Allen showcased his MVP potential by throwing two touchdown passes and running for another, making him the first NFL player to score 40 touchdowns in five straight seasons. Despite offseason skepticism and major roster changes, including the departure of key players like Stefon Diggs, the Bills broke franchise records for points and touchdowns in a single season. Their defense was dominant, forcing three turnovers and sacking Aaron Rodgers four times, including a safety. Rodgers, who became the most sacked quarterback in NFL history, had a forgettable game, leaving the Jets to face a 14-season playoff drought. The Bills' win reflected their "everybody eats" philosophy on offense, with Tyrell Shavers becoming the 13th player on the team to catch a touchdown pass this season, tying an NFL record.

**Jacksonville Jaguars 20 - 13 Tennessee Titans**  
In a rainy matchup, the Jacksonville Jaguars secured a 20-13 victory over the Tennessee Titans, achieving a rare series sweep for only the fourth time in 30 years. Rookie sensation Brian Thomas Jr. continued his historic season, scoring his 10th touchdown, tying an NFL rookie record set by Randy Moss for the most games with at least 60 yards and a score. Mac Jones connected with Thomas for one of his two touchdown passes, finishing with 174 passing yards, while Thomas caught seven passes for 91 yards. Despite strong defensive efforts, including three sacks on the Titans' quarterback Mason Rudolph and a crucial pass defense by Antonio Johnson, the Jaguars ended the season with a 4-12 record. On the other hand, the Titans sat at the bottom of the AFC South with a 3-13 record, potentially earning them a top draft pick to address their quarterback situation. Additionally, Jaguars' Josh Hines-Allen closed in on a franchise sack record, and referee Boris Cheek set a new NFL record for the most games officiated.

**Tampa Bay Buccaneers 48 - 14 Carolina Panthers**  
In a dominant display, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers surged closer to the playoffs with a convincing 48-14 win over the Carolina Panthers, driven by a standout performance from Baker Mayfield, who threw for 359 yards and five touchdowns without interceptions. The victory, coupled with Atlanta's overtime loss to Washington, propelled the Bucs to first place in the NFC South. Special teams shone as J.J. Russell returned a blocked punt for a touchdown, while rookie Bucky Irving rushed for 120 yards and received for 77, surpassing 1,000 yards for the season. Joe Tryon-Shoyinka's blocked punt and Mayfield's effective distribution highlighted Tampa Bay's dominance. The Buccaneers now eye a division title against the New Orleans Saints, needing one more win and minimal assistance. Despite missing key players such as Chuba Hubbard and an unimpressive 39-yard rushing total, the Panthers' Bryce Young found Adam Thielen for two touchdowns but was sacked five times. Meanwhile, Mike Evans sits on the brink of history, needing 85 yards next week to match Jerry Rice's record of consecutive 1,000-yard seasons.

**Minnesota Vikings 27 - 25 Green Bay Packers**  
The Minnesota Vikings secured a thrilling 27-25 win over the Green Bay Packers, highlighted by Sam Darnold's impressive performance with a career-high 377 passing yards and three touchdowns. Darnold's stellar play has helped him become the first quarterback in NFL history to win 14 games in his first season with a team, bringing the Vikings tantalizingly close to clinching the NFC's top seed. His touchdowns to Jalen Nailor, Jordan Addison, and Cam Akers increased his season total to 35, positioning him fourth in NFL history for the most touchdown passes in a debut season. Although the Vikings faced a late surge from the Packers, Darnold's composure and decisive plays, including crucial completions to C.J. Ham and Justin Jefferson, secured their ninth consecutive victory. The win sets up a crucial showdown against the Detroit Lions for the NFC North title and a first-round bye. Despite the close loss, the Packers continue to struggle against top-tier teams, going 0-5 against the NFC's best.

**New Orleans Saints 10 - 25 Las Vegas Raiders**  
The Las Vegas Raiders, overcoming significant travel delays, secured a decisive 25-10 victory against the New Orleans Saints, marking only their fourth win of the season. Aidan O'Connell threw for 242 yards and two touchdowns, while rookie tight end Brock Bowers set NFL records by surpassing both the 1961 rookie receiving yards record for tight ends and the 2023 rookie single-season reception record at any position. Bowers also broke the Raiders' franchise record for receptions in a season. Despite the challenging start to their day, which included getting into their hotel after midnight, the Raiders rallied enthusiastically, with Ameer Abdullah achieving his first 100-yard rushing game of his career. Meanwhile, Saints rookie QB Spencer Rattler struggled in place of the injured Derek Carr, leaving New Orleans winless in Rattler's starts and facing internal challenges, highlighted by offensive missteps and more player injuries.

**Philadelphia Eagles 41 - 7 Dallas Cowboys**  
The Philadelphia Eagles dominated the Dallas Cowboys 41-7 to clinch the NFC East title, with Saquon Barkley surpassing 2,000 rushing yards for the season, inching closer to Eric Dickerson’s NFL record. Barkley, who joined the Eagles after leaving the Giants, set a new record for the most rushing yards in a player’s first season with a new team. Backup quarterback Kenny Pickett shone in his first start for the Eagles, throwing for 143 yards before a rib injury forced him out, making way for Tanner McKee, who threw two touchdown passes. The Eagles' defense made significant plays, with C.J. Gardner-Johnson returning an interception for a touchdown, helping secure the win in front of over 60,000 fans. Despite injuries, the Eagles positioning themselves as one of the top playoff contenders, while Dallas, plagued by injuries, struggled. The Cowboys' woes were compounded by a knee injury to safety Donovan Wilson and the shutdown of WR CeeDee Lamb due to a shoulder sprain.

**Washington Commanders 30 - 24 Atlanta Falcons**  
Jayden Daniels once again showcased his talent, leading the Washington Commanders to a thrilling 30-24 overtime victory against the Atlanta Falcons, securing a playoff spot. Daniels threw three touchdown passes, connecting with Zach Ertz for the decisive score in overtime. Despite a 10-point halftime deficit and a previous interception, Daniels maintained his poise, rushing for a season-high 127 yards and completing 24 of 36 passes for 227 yards. His performance this season has been remarkable, tying him with Russell Wilson for the third most combined touchdowns by a rookie quarterback. The Falcons, who initially controlled the game with Bijan Robinson's strong running, lost momentum in the second half. Despite a late-game effort, including a touchdown pass from rookie quarterback Michael Penix to Kyle Pitts, the Falcons fell short when Riley Patterson missed a potential game-winning 56-yard field goal. With the win, the Commanders improved to 11-5 and could better their playoff seeding with a win against Dallas, while the Falcons, now 8-8, need to defeat Carolina and hope for a Buccaneers loss to stay in playoff contention.

**New York Giants 45 - 33 Indianapolis Colts**  
The New York Giants snapped a franchise-record 10-game losing streak with a 45-33 victory over the Indianapolis Colts, effectively eliminating the Colts from playoff contention. Giants quarterback Drew Lock led the effort with four touchdown passes and a rushing TD, including impressive connections with Malik Nabers, who had a standout game with seven catches for a career-high 171 yards. Despite their struggles this season, the Giants (3-13) celebrated their first home win, marking their most points scored in a game since 2015. Lock's performance was a comeback after a rough game against Atlanta, and he solidified the win with a late drive. For the Colts, Joe Flacco stepped in for the injured Anthony Richardson, managing two TD passes and 330 yards. However, their playoff aspirations were dashed after the loss. The highlight for the Colts was Jonathan Taylor's two touchdowns, but it wasn't enough to secure the needed win. The game also witnessed rookies Malik Nabers and Tyrone Tracy achieving over 1,000 yards from scrimmage in the same season, reminiscent of Reggie Bush and Marques Colston in 2006.

**Cleveland Browns 3 - 20 Miami Dolphins**  
Tyler Huntley stepped in for the injured Tua Tagovailoa and led the Miami Dolphins to a 20-3 victory over the Cleveland Browns, keeping their playoff hopes alive. Huntley, who joined Miami after being cut by Cleveland, threw for a touchdown and ran for another, finishing 22 of 26 for 225 yards with no turnovers in challenging windy and wet conditions. Despite Tua's absence due to a hip injury, Huntley's performance kept Miami in the AFC wild-card race as they head into a crucial season finale against the New York Jets. For Miami to make the playoffs, they need a win and for the Broncos to lose, with the challenge heightened by the Chiefs potentially resting their top players. The game highlighted Miami's strong defense, as they harassed Browns quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson into multiple turnovers. Additionally, Myles Garrett marked his 29th birthday with two sacks, becoming the first player to record 14 sacks in four consecutive seasons. Miami kicker Jason Sanders impressed by extending his franchise-record streak to 25 consecutive field goals.
