**Brooklyn Nets 119 - 101 New Orleans Pelicans**  
Michael Porter Jr. delivered a standout performance with 35 points, matching his season high and helping the Brooklyn Nets secure a 119-101 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans. Porter, who sat out Thursday to rest his back, hit five 3-pointers and grabbed nine rebounds, achieving his third consecutive 30-point game, a feat he also accomplished last February with Denver. Nic Claxton contributed significantly with his second triple-double of the season, joining the ranks of Nets players like James Harden and Kevin Durant who achieved multiple triple-doubles in a season in 2021-22. Claxton's performance made him the second Nets center with multiple career triple-doubles, following Shawn Bradley's record from the 1990s. Day'Ron Sharpe also shone with 16 points, aiding the Nets to win their third game in four outings. Meanwhile, Trey Murphy III led the Pelicans with 23 points as they suffered their sixth consecutive loss.
