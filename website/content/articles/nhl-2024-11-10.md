“I didn’t know that, but I guess it shows I’ve had a good team in front of me for the last 17 seasons,” Quick said. “Getting a shutout is never just down to the goalie – you need a lot of help from your teammates.”

<forge-entity title="Martin Brodeur" slug="martin-brodeur-8455710" code="player">Martin Brodeur</forge-entity> holds the record with a shutout in 21 straight seasons (1993-94 to 2014-15).

<forge-entity title="Artemi Panarin" slug="artemi-panarin-8478550" code="player">Artemi Panarin</forge-entity> had a goal and an assist, and <forge-entity title="Adam Fox" slug="adam-fox-8479323" code="player">Adam Fox</forge-entity> had two assists for the Rangers (9-3-1), who have defeated the Red Wings three times this season by a combined score of 9-3.

<forge-entity title="Chris Kreider" slug="chris-kreider-8475184" code="player">Chris Kreider</forge-entity> gave the Rangers a 1-0 lead at 13:13 of the first period, scoring seven seconds into the game’s first power-play opportunity when he tipped Fox’s shot under Husso.

“Throughout the season, you are going to have games like this,” Kane said. “We created a lot tonight. Obviously you have to find a way to produce and get the puck past the goalie, but we have to be happy with what we created.” 
The Red Wings outshot New York 19-8 in the second period.

“I thought we fed them the puck too many times in that period,” Laviolette said. “I think the third was our only good period.”

**St Louis Blues 1 - 8 Washington Capitals**  
The Washington Capitals delivered a commanding performance with an 8-1 victory over the St. Louis Blues, highlighted by Alex Ovechkin's two goals that brought his career total to 863, just 31 shy of Wayne Gretzky's NHL record.

Logan Thompson continued his perfect start with a 7-0-0 record by making 24 saves.

<forge-entity title="Roman Josi" slug="roman-josi-8474600" code="player">Roman Josi</forge-entity> had two assists for the Predators (5-9-1), who ended a three-game losing streak.

“I thought that was a pretty complete hockey game from our club,” Forsberg said. “I thought we came out really, really good in the first. Obviously, got two on the power play, but other than that I thought it was a solid defensive performance. \[Saros\] made some great saves when we needed him. I think our stick detail against a team that thrives on time and space, I thought we did that really well.”

<forge-entity title="Connor Ingram" slug="connor-ingram-8478971" code="player">Connor Ingram</forge-entity> made 17 saves for Utah (6-6-3), which has lost three of four (1-2-1).

“They played hard,” Utah coach Andre Tourigny said. “Give them credit. I think they capitalized on their power play in the first, and then from there it was tough to get to their slot and generate quality chances.

“We tried to have some broken plays, but I think on our side we need to find a way to generate more offense from our \[offensive\] zone play. I think our rush has come to life right now. We’re having more speed through the neutral zone, a few good looks, but we need to find a way to generate more from our \[offensive\] zone play.” 
Forsberg gave the Predators a 1-0 lead at 2:37 of the first period on a wrist shot from the top of the left circle on the power play.

Marchessault gave the Predators a 2-0 lead at 11:58 of the first period on a redirection of a shot from the point by Josi on the power play.

“Sometimes it’s about getting chances, and I felt tonight I had a couple chances,” Marchessault said. “So that’s a positive. Score or don’t score, I think at the end of the day I just want scoring chances. That means I’m doing something good. And create chances for my teammates as well. I think tonight was a more desperate group that we had.”

Forsberg gave the Predators a 3-0 lead at 11:05 of the second period. Skating up from his own blue line, he split Utah defensemen <forge-entity title="Michael Kesselring" slug="michael-kesselring-8480891" code="player">Michael Kesselring</forge-entity> and <forge-entity title="Olli Maatta" slug="olli-maatta-8476874" code="player">Olli Maatta</forge-entity>, cut to the middle of the ice and beat Ingram on the glove side.

“Well, it was just basically ‘I’m going to grab the puck, go around everybody and score a goal,” Predators coach Andrew Brunette said. “It was a big goal. Obviously, for our group, that was much needed, that three-goal lead. To see \[Forsberg\] be \[Forsberg\] and take over a game was really important for our group.” 
Marchessault scored an empty-net goal to make it 4-0 at 18:15 of the third period.

“It’s still a long season,” Utah forward <forge-entity title="Kevin Stenlund" slug="kevin-stenlund-8478831" code="player">Kevin Stenlund</forge-entity> said. “I mean we’ve got a new one on Wednesday. Just got to focus on that one and try to get the two points.”

It was the second time in the past three games that Utah has been shut out.

“I think defensively we played good enough,” Tourigny said. “But offensively we need to find a way to generate more offense without sacrificing our defense. That’s urgent for us.”

**NOTES:** Marchessault had his first multigoal game with the Predators. He had 30 with the Vegas Golden Knights in the previous seven seasons, the franchise record. … Saros has 18 NHL shutouts, second in Predators history behind <forge-entity title="Pekka Rinne" slug="pekka-rinne-8471469" code="player">Pekka Rinne</forge-entity> (43). … Predators forward <forge-entity title="Colton Sissons" slug="colton-sissons-8476925" code="player">Colton Sissons</forge-entity> returned to the lineup after missing one game because of an upper-body injury.
