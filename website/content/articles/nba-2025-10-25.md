Jalen Brunson's impressive 31-point performance led the New York Knicks to a 105-95 victory over the Boston Celtics at Madison Square Garden, giving them a 2-0 start to the season. The Knicks capitalized on a dominant second quarter, outscoring Boston 42-14 and securing a 64-44 halftime lead.

Meanwhile, Jaylen Brown scored 23 points on his birthday for the Celtics, who suffered their second consecutive loss, highlighting their defensive struggles evident in previous games.

**Los Angeles Lakers 128 - 110 Minnesota Timberwolves**  
In a game that revisited last season's playoff series, the Minnesota Timberwolves beat the Los Angeles Lakers 118-114, showcasing a standout performance from Anthony Edwards who, despite back spasms, scored 41 points and made a crucial 3-pointer near the end. This victory came after Minnesota advanced to the Western Conference finals last season, while the Lakers struggled without LeBron James due to a sciatica injury. The absence of James and Maxi Kleber left the Lakers reliant on Austin Reaves, who delivered 26 points, but with Luka Doncic stepping up with 43 points, 12 rebounds, and nine assists before facing a minor injury concern. However, he downplayed its severity. Los Angeles struggled with 3-point shooting and free throws, converting only 25% from range and 60.7% from the line. Adding to their woes, the Lakers couldn’t overcome an 18-4 scoring run by Golden State in the third quarter, highlighting a recurring issue they face after halftime, as noted by head coach JJ Redick.

Notably, the Hawks played without key players Zaccharie Risacher, due to injury, and Kristaps Porzingis, who was ill. Despite this, Nikeil Alexander-Walker and Onyeka Okongwu contributed significantly, with 19 and 17 points respectively. The Hawks overcame a late-game deficit with a 15-0 run and held off Orlando, who struggled from the three-point line, making only 28.1% of their attempts overall.

Despite Cleveland's commanding 25-point lead in the third quarter, the Nets mounted a fierce comeback, led by Cam Thomas and Michael Porter Jr., who scored 33 and 31 points respectively. Key moments included a brief court invasion by a fan, and a dramatic 3-pointer by Brooklyn's rookie Egor Demin that narrowed the gap to one point with just under four minutes left.

Milwaukee managed to pull away in the fourth quarter, outscoring Toronto 36-30, aided by Cole Anthony, who contributed nine of his 23 points in the decisive period. Antetokounmpo's dominance in the paint was evident as he hit 11 of 14 shots, mostly inside, where his strength and speed were too much for Toronto's defense. Despite Brandon Ingram scoring 29 points and RJ Barrett adding 20 for the Raptors, the Bucks secured their second consecutive win to open the season. Notably, Bucks forward Kyle Kuzma exited early in the fourth quarter due to a sprained left ankle, adding a concern for Milwaukee as they prepare to face Cleveland next.

Despite Kevin Durant's impressive 37-point performance for the Rockets, including a perfect 3-for-3 from beyond the arc, Detroit managed to secure their first win of the season. The game featured a brotherly showdown as Detroit's Ausar Thompson outscored his twin, Houston's Amen Thompson, 19 to 10. The Pistons built a lead with a late 6-0 run after Durant had kept Houston in contention, but Cunningham's late free throws sealed the victory after a series of missed opportunities by both teams.

**Portland Trail Blazers 139 - 119 Golden State Warriors**  
The Portland Trail Blazers faced significant challenges both on and off the court this week as they geared up to host the Golden State Warriors. After losing their season opener against the Minnesota Timberwolves 118-114, amid a fourth-quarter slump where they shot only 21.1%, they were further disrupted by the legal troubles of head coach Chauncey Billups. Billups was placed on leave after being charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering, leading Tiago Splitter to become the first Brazilian to serve as an NBA head coach. Despite these upheavals, Portland could take solace in the performance of Jerami Grant, who scored 29 points off the bench. Meanwhile, the Warriors extended their streak against the Blazers to nine consecutive wins, following a thrilling 137-131 overtime victory over the Denver Nuggets, where Stephen Curry dazzled with 42 points, including 35 after halftime. As the Warriors aim for a strong start to the season, they also anticipate the return of Moses Moody while Al Horford will rest against Portland. Curry underscored the importance of maintaining momentum as they prepare for a demanding Western Conference schedule.

The Kings, dealing with injuries to key players Domantas Sabonis and Keegan Murray, will rely on home-court advantage, a strength emphasized by coach Doug Christie. They began the season featuring new talent, with Dennis Schroder leading the charge alongside free agent additions and holdovers. Meanwhile, the Jazz's notable offseason acquisition, Ace Bailey, played a supportive role in their recent win.

**LA Clippers 127 - 99 Phoenix Suns**  
In their 2025-26 home opener at Intuit Dome, the Los Angeles Clippers are set to face the Phoenix Suns after a disappointing start to the season with a 129-108 loss to the Utah Jazz. The Clippers struggled defensively and offensively in that game, with James Harden contributing 15 points and 11 assists, and new acquisition Bradley Beal scoring only five points against his former team. Coach Tyronn Lue criticized the team's defensive mindset and highlighted offensive spacing issues. Meanwhile, the Suns, who traded Kevin Durant in the offseason, rely on Devin Booker, who led his team to a comeback victory over Sacramento with 31 points. Dillon Brooks, also new to the Suns, added 22 points despite poor 3-point shooting. As these two teams clash, the Clippers will hope to reverse their prior losses to the Suns at home, while the Suns aim to continue their winning momentum with Booker’s impactful performance and Grayson Allen’s strong 3-point shooting.
