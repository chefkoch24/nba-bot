The Cleveland Cavaliers secured their 20th victory of the season by defeating the Denver Nuggets 126-114, improving to an impressive 13-1 home record. Donovan Mitchell and Darius Garland led the charge with 28 and 24 points, respectively, as the Cavs set a season-high with 22 successful 3-pointers and extended their streak of making at least 10 threes to a club record 28 games. Despite a standout performance from Nikola Jokic, who recorded his 139th career triple-double (27 points, 20 rebounds, 11 assists), surpassing Magic Johnson, the Nuggets struggled defensively against Cleveland's deep shooting.

**Washington Wizards 101 - 137 Dallas Mavericks**  
The Dallas Mavericks cruised to a commanding 137-101 victory over the Washington Wizards, marking their sixth consecutive win. Luka Doncic notched his 78th career triple-double with 21 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists, tying him with Wilt Chamberlain and James Harden for seventh-most in NBA history. This overwhelming loss was the Wizards' 16th straight defeat, tying their franchise record for consecutive losses, a mark they've now matched for the second season in a row. Despite an early competitive start, Washington could not maintain pace, especially as Dallas hit 11 of their first 16 three-point attempts and finished the game with a remarkable 20 of 38 from beyond the arc. Missing key players Kyle Kuzma and Corey Kispert due to injuries, Washington continues to struggle, with their last win coming before Halloween, and faces a challenging schedule ahead with matchups against teams above .500. The Wizards join a small group of teams with such extended losing streaks in back-to-back seasons, highlighting their current woes. Meanwhile, the Mavericks continue their streak with upcoming games against Toronto, while the Wizards will face the Denver Nuggets.
