The Utah Jazz snapped their season-worst 10-game losing streak with a 128-112 victory over the Washington Wizards in Salt Lake City. Kyle Filipowski led the Jazz with 21 points, while Keyonte George contributed 20, and Collin Sexton and Brice Sensabaugh added 18 and 17 points, respectively.

**Miami Heat 113 - 116 Detroit Pistons**  
Cade Cunningham's late heroics secured a dramatic victory for the Detroit Pistons as his banked 3-pointer with less than a second left led to a 116-113 win over the Miami Heat, who suffered their ninth consecutive loss. Cunningham achieved his ninth triple-double of the season with 25 points, 12 rebounds, and 11 assists. Despite trailing for much of the second half, the Pistons only took their final lead in the last second. Miami's Bam Adebayo had a notable performance with 30 points, nine rebounds, and eight assists, yet the Heat's struggles continued, marking their longest losing streak since the 2007-08 season and their 12th loss this season after leading at any point in the fourth quarter. The Pistons were favored pre-game, breaking Miami's 20-game streak as favorites over Detroit since February 2019. Miami's Tyler Herro contributed 29 points, but the team was outrebounded 47-37 and allowed 70 points in the paint. Cunningham, now with two triple-doubles against Miami this season, joins elite company, becoming the fourth player to achieve this feat.

**Minnesota Timberwolves 115 - 119 New Orleans Pelicans**  
The New Orleans Pelicans secured a surprising 119-115 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves, with Zion Williamson contributing 29 points and CJ McCollum adding 18. Despite building a substantial lead early on, the Timberwolves could not maintain their momentum, allowing the Pelicans to launch a 14-0 run that put them ahead. Anthony Edwards led Minnesota with 29 points but struggled with his shooting, going 5-of-19 from the field. The loss pushes Minnesota, who had previously won eight straight games, a full game behind the Golden State Warriors in their battle for the No. 6 seed in the Western Conference. This win marked only the Pelicans' seventh road victory of the season, despite having lost their forward Trey Murphy III for the season due to a shoulder injury earlier in the week. New Orleans demonstrated depth in scoring, with six players reaching double figures, capitalizing on a rare offensive rebound to secure their win. The teams are set for a rematch on Friday in Minneapolis.

The Oklahoma City Thunder, led by Jaylin Williams' standout performance with a career-high 19 points, 17 rebounds, and 11 assists for his second career triple-double, comfortably defeated the short-handed Philadelphia 76ers 133-100. The Thunder, who played without star player Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and several other starters, clinched the Northwest Division title and edged closer to securing the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference. Aaron Wiggins also contributed significantly with 26 points as seven Thunder players reached double figures. The game featured a remarkable shooting display with both teams combining for 109 three-point attempts, and the 76ers setting a franchise record with 57 attempts. Despite a competitive first half, Philadelphia, missing key players like Joel Embiid and Paul George for the rest of the season, could not keep up with Oklahoma City's depth in the second half, as the Thunder went on a decisive 33-14 run in the third quarter.

**San Antonio Spurs 120 - 105 New York Knicks**

Mamukelashvili's explosive play included scoring 13 points in eight minutes during the first half and contributing 21 points in the final quarter, helping the Spurs solidify their lead. Stephon Castle added 22 points, while Chris Paul contributed 12 points and nine assists for San Antonio. Notably, San Antonio secured this victory despite the absence of key players Victor Wembanyama and De'Aaron Fox due to season-ending injuries. For the Knicks, Karl-Anthony Towns led with 32 points and nine rebounds, but New York suffered a significant second-quarter lapse and struggled with rebounding against a shorter Spurs lineup. This win was a bright spot for the Spurs, who captured their third victory in eight games.

In a commanding performance, Luka Doncic spearheaded the Los Angeles Lakers to a 120-108 victory over the Denver Nuggets, contributing 31 points, nine rebounds, and seven assists in just three quarters. Despite facing the absence of key players such as LeBron James and Rui Hachimura, the Lakers displayed exceptional team balance, with six players scoring in double figures, including Austin Reaves with 22 points and eight assists. Los Angeles, enjoying a streak of nine consecutive home victories, erupted for a season-high 46 points in the first quarter, with Doncic delivering 21 of those, marking his highest-scoring quarter of the season. The Nuggets, missing both Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray, struggled defensively, as the Lakers made 60% of their shots in the first three quarters. Doncic, who hit the 30-point mark for the 200th time in his NBA career, allowed himself some rest in the final quarter, as the Lakers cruised to their third straight win since a dismal road trip. Notably, Bronny James also took to the floor in the game's closing minutes. The Lakers next face the Milwaukee Bucks at home, while the Nuggets travel to Portland to play the Trail Blazers.

Devin Booker was the standout performer for the Phoenix Suns, scoring 41 points, with 20 coming in a pivotal fourth quarter, to lead his team to a thrilling 127-121 victory over the Chicago Bulls. Kevin Durant contributed significantly with 26 points and eight assists, while Nick Richards added 18 points, nine rebounds, and three blocks. Despite a late surge from the Bulls, led by Coby White and Nikola Vucevic with 24 points each, Booker sealed the game with seven points in the waning moments, including a vital layup and clutch free throws. The win propelled the Suns into 10th place in the Western Conference, enhancing their position for the play-in tournament, whereas the Bulls dropped to ninth in the Eastern Conference. The Suns secured a significant advantage from the free-throw line, outscoring the Bulls 18-8, and capitalized on second-chance points, which were a decisive factor in their victory.

**Portland Trail Blazers 115 - 99 Memphis Grizzlies**  
Deni Avdija delivered a standout performance with 31 points, 16 rebounds, and eight assists to propel the Portland Trail Blazers to a decisive 115-99 win against the Memphis Grizzlies. Anfernee Simons contributed 22 points as part of a strong team effort that saw the Blazers lead by as much as 21 points in the third quarter. Although Desmond Bane's 20 points helped Memphis close the gap to seven by the end of the third, defensive efforts and a pivotal three-pointer by Avdija sealed Portland's advantage. Notably, the matchup featured a reunion between former NCAA championship foes Zach Edey of Memphis and Donovan Clingan of Portland, with Clingan outperforming despite Edey's limited play due to foul trouble. The Grizzlies’ attempt to rally in the fourth quarter was hampered by Jaren Jackson Jr.'s foul and technical frustration, diminishing their chances of narrowing the margin that Portland maintained through rebounding dominance. The victory edged the Blazers closer to a play-in tournament spot, while Memphis fell behind the Lakers in the standings.

Malik Monk added 20 points for Sacramento, which overcame a historically poor 1 for 11 shooting start from two-point range in the first quarter. Evan Mobley shone for Cleveland, scoring 22 of his 31 points in the final 15 minutes, while Donovan Mitchell added 26 points. However, their efforts couldn't prevent the Cavaliers from matching their longest skid of the season following a 16-game winning streak.
