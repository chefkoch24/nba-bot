Despite a strong performance by Sharks goalie Yaroslav Askarov, who made a career-high 39 saves, the Oilers secured their second consecutive overtime victory, adding to a strong run of seven wins in their last eight games.

Geekie's power-play goal in the third period, assisted by David Pastrnak, was crucial in securing the win, although another potential goal was nullified due to offside. JJ Peterka scored for the Sabres, who suffered their 13th consecutive loss, a streak threatening to become the franchise's second-longest. Sabres coach Lindy Ruff and players stressed the importance of focusing on positives amidst their struggles. Marchand's streak puts him alongside Bruins legends Jean Ratelle and Johnny Bucyk as the third player aged 36 or older to achieve this feat.

The Canadiens demonstrated a relentless offensive strategy, controlling the game and extending their winning streak to three games, the first such streak of their season.

**New Jersey Devils 3 - 0 Pittsburgh Penguins**  
Hischier gets 3 points, Devils shut out Penguins
 **NEWARK, N.J. --** <forge-entity title="Nico Hischier" slug="nico-hischier-8480002" code="player">Nico Hischier</forge-entity> had a goal and two assists for the New Jersey Devils in a 3-0 win against the Pittsburgh Penguins at Prudential Center on Saturday. 
"I think we're a pretty confident group right now," Hischier said. "We're still trying to get better every day, finding consistency in our game. If you're strong in your defensive zone, you're definitely going to win more games than lose."

<forge-entity title="Timo Meier" slug="timo-meier-8478414" code="player">Timo Meier</forge-entity> had a goal and an assist, and <forge-entity title="Jacob Markstrom" slug="jacob-markstrom-8474593" code="player">Jacob Markstrom</forge-entity> made 12 saves for his second shutout of the season for the Devils (22-11-3), who are 4-1-0 in their past five games. New Jersey has limited the opposition to 20-or-fewer shots in six straight games.

"From day one, \[coach Sheldon Keefe\] preached about the defense," Devils defenseman <forge-entity title="Brenden Dillon" slug="brenden-dillon-8475455" code="player">Brenden Dillon</forge-entity> said. "We know what we have in this room offensively. It just shows the type of team we can be when we do commit."

It was New Jersey's first shutout against Pittsburgh since a 3-0 win on March 24, 2016. 
<forge-entity title="Tristan Jarry" slug="tristan-jarry-8477465" code="player">Tristan Jarry</forge-entity> made 25 saves for the Penguins (15-15-5), who lost in regulation for the first time in five games (3-1-1).

"They were using the middle of the ice really well and attacking us," Jarry said. "They were able to get to the net front and battle hard. We could have done a better job in the third period."

Markstrom had four saves in the second period, including a glove stop while diving to his left to force <forge-entity title="Sidney Crosby" slug="sidney-crosby-8471675" code="player">Sidney Crosby</forge-entity> off the right post at 3:42.

"We stayed calm even though I don't think we played our best game," Hischier said. "\[Markstrom\] made some huge saves for us to keep us in the game, and we just stuck with it and eventually got the win."

<forge-entity title="Stefan Noesen" slug="stefan-noesen-8476474" code="player">Stefan Noesen</forge-entity> gave the Devils a 1-0 lead at 17:32 of the second. Hischier spun away from Penguins defenseman <forge-entity title="Owen Pickering" slug="owen-pickering-8483503" code="player">Owen Pickering</forge-entity> along the right wing half boards and backhanded a pass to Noesen in the slot for his NHL career-high 15th goal of the season.

"I think it was opening up for a one-timer, but it was a nice high sauce by \[Meier\]," Hischier said. "I think \[the spin move\] is just something that naturally happens when you're on the ice, holding onto pucks and cutting back."

Markstrom, who earned the 22nd shutout of his NHL career, denied <forge-entity title="Philip Tomasino" slug="philip-tomasino-8481577" code="player">Philip Tomasino</forge-entity> skating down the slot with a left pad save at 6:40 of the third period.

"We're going to make mistakes and when we do, it's nice to have a guy back there like him," Dillon said of Markstrom. "It's nice to get the win, bear down and get the shutout."

Hischier pushed it to 2-0 on a snap shot at the right post at 7:47 of the third while Noesen was jostling with defenseman <forge-entity title="Ryan Shea" slug="ryan-shea-8478854" code="player">Ryan Shea</forge-entity> for position in the slot.

"I actually thought I was about to fight so I was a little surprised it went in," Noesen said. "\[Keefe's\] really trusting me and they signed me to play kind of down the lineup and that's kind of what I think I do best. Whatever you need me to do ... you tell me to run through a wall, you tell me to do this, I'll try to do that." 
Meier scored an empty-net goal at 18:27 for the 3-0 final.

"I thought after they got the second goal, we opened up a little, and that's where they got a bunch of their shots," Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan said. "They defend well. I thought for two-and-a-half periods we competed hard and were right there.

"We had two Grade A opportunities in the second period and didn't score on either of them."

**NOTES:** Pickering sustained an upper-body injury after a hit by Paul Cotter at 14:11 of the second period and didn't return to the game; there was no update after the game. ... <forge-entity title="Pierre-Olivier Joseph" slug="pierre-olivier-joseph-8480058" code="player">Pierre-Olivier Joseph</forge-entity> had no shots and three giveaways in 18:49 of ice time in his season debut for the Penguins after the defenseman was acquired in a trade with the St. Louis Blues on Dec. 18. ... Hischier's three-point night gives him 82 points (36 goals, 46 assists) in a calendar year for the first time in his career (83 games). The last Devils captain to score at least 80 points in a calendar year was Patrik Elias (82 in 2006). ... New Jersey is 11-3-2 when scoring the first goal of the game and 17-0-1 when leading after two periods.

**Winnipeg Jets 5 - 0 Minnesota Wild**  
Hellebuyck gets 4th shutout, Jets defeat Wild
 **WINNIPEG --** <forge-entity title="Connor Hellebuyck" slug="connor-hellebuyck-8476945" code="player">Connor Hellebuyck</forge-entity> made 19 saves for his NHL-leading fourth shutout of the season, and the Winnipeg Jets won 5-0 against the Minnesota Wild at Canada Life Centre on Saturday. 
“It’s probably one of our better efforts in the last few games here,” Winnipeg coach Scott Arniel said. “We knew they were coming in after playing last night, went after them in the first period and kind of continued that through the three periods. Liked a lot of our compete, sort of our little details. A lot of good things that happened tonight.”

<forge-entity title="Cole Perfetti" slug="cole-perfetti-8482149" code="player">Cole Perfetti</forge-entity> had a goal and two assists and <forge-entity title="Neal Pionk" slug="neal-pionk-8480145" code="player">Neal Pionk</forge-entity> had a goal and an assist for the Jets (24-10-1), who have points in five of six (4-1-1).

“We wanted to have a good start. We haven’t had that as of late.” Perfetti said. “Our first period was huge, and we really wanted to take them out of the game. And I think we did that. We really didn’t give them anything. \[We were\] hard on the puck, hard on the forecheck. We really suffocated them all over the ice.” 
<forge-entity title="Jesper Wallstedt" slug="jesper-wallstedt-8482661" code="player">Jesper Wallstedt</forge-entity> made 19 saves for the Wild (20-10-4), who were shut out for the first time this season and have lost four straight, including a 2-1 loss at home to the Utah Hockey Club on Friday.

“It’s about having the right mindset and playing the game the right way,” Minnesota coach John Hynes said. “We have capable players, and we’ve got to get back to playing a certain style of game and being consistent with that. We have it in pockets, we don’t have it enough.”

<forge-entity title="Nikolaj Ehlers" slug="nikolaj-ehlers-8477940" code="player">Nikolaj Ehlers</forge-entity> made it 1-0 Jets with a power play goal at 6:51 of the first period, sweeping the puck under Wallstedt from the netside.

“When you see his speed like that, when \[Ehlers\] puts it on display, it’s nerve-wracking for the opposition and especially the defenders who have to play that side of the ice,” Arniel said. “It just creates offensive zone time for that group. I thought those three \[Ehlers, Perfetti, and <forge-entity title="Vladislav Namestnikov" slug="vladislav-namestnikov-8476480" code="player">Vladislav Namestnikov</forge-entity>\] did a really good job and spent a lot of time down in that end of the rink, and they got rewarded for it.”

<forge-entity title="Morgan Barron" slug="morgan-barron-8480289" code="player">Morgan Barron</forge-entity> scored at 17:54 to make it 2-0. <forge-entity title="Alex Iafallo" slug="alex-iafallo-8480113" code="player">Alex Iafallo</forge-entity>’s one-timer on a 2-on-1 rush beat Wallstedt, leaving Barron to jam in the loose puck in the crease.

“I saw him get the shot off and then I kind of lost it,” Barron said. “Then it popped out. Honestly, I thought I could have done a better job stopping at the net before -- I almost kind of swung behind, but stopped just in time.”

Pionk pushed it to 3-0 on the power play with a one-timer from the point at 5:19 of the second period.

“I knew coming in that they were going to be a very skilled power play,” Wallstedt said. “They have a lot of options and a lot of stuff that they can do, and I felt like I had good knowledge, but I just didn't execute the whole when it was needed. \[They have\] very, very good players on the power play and knew what they were doing.” 
Perfetti made it 4-0 at 2:07 into the third period, scoring unassisted with a shot from the high slot after Wild defenseman Jonas Brodin turned it over in his own zone.

“We’ve got to stick to what gives us the best chance to win,” Hynes said. “I thought we went a little bit off script and made plays and went east-west and passed up shots. To me, that’s the bigger thing. It’s more the process of the game than it is anything about the mindset. The mindset needs to be to play the game the right way and play the game that gives us the best chance to win, gives us the best chance to produce offense, the best way to check.”

Namestnikov tipped Pionk’s point shot at 7:36 for the 5-0 final.

“A 5-0 loss, it happens in a season,” Wild forward <forge-entity title="Frederick Gaudreau" slug="frederick-gaudreau-8477919" code="player">Frederick Gaudreau</forge-entity> said. “We're going through one of those moments right now and when you look at things with perspectives, it happens to everybody. You just have to stay positive and dig yourselves out of what we're into right now all together.”

**NOTES:** Jets forward <forge-entity title="Adam Lowry" slug="adam-lowry-8476392" code="player">Adam Lowry</forge-entity> left the game midway through the third period. "He was just banged up a little bit there,” Arniel said. “He got banged up on one of his shifts. He should be fine." … The Jets swept the three-game season series, winning 2-1 in overtime Oct. 13 in Winnipeg, and 4-1 on Nov. 25 in Minnesota. … Winnipeg has won eight straight against Minnesota. … Hellebuyck is 6-0-1 in his past seven starts. … With 41 shutouts, Hellebuyck passed John Vanbiesbrouck and Frank Brimsek (both with 40) for the fourth-most by a United States-born goalie in NHL history.
