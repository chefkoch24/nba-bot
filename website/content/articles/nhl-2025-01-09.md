**Washington Capitals 2 - 1 Vancouver Canucks**  
In an exciting matchup at Capital One Arena, Pierre-Luc Dubois led the Washington Capitals to a thrilling 2-1 overtime win against the Vancouver Canucks by scoring both of Washington's goals, including the game-winner with just 41 seconds left in overtime. Logan Thompson made 30 saves, extending the Capitals' point streak to five games and their home point streak to nine games. Despite being outshot 21-5 in the second period, Washington managed to hold on with Conor Garland equalizing for the Canucks late in the period. Kevin Lankinen made 16 saves for Vancouver, but couldn't stop Dubois from netting the winner after Aliaksei Protas set him up with a clever pass. Meanwhile, Capitals star Alex Ovechkin was held scoreless and remains 23 goals away from surpassing Wayne Gretzky's NHL record.

**Chicago Blackhawks 3 - 1 Colorado Avalanche**  
Connor Bedard extended his point streak to eight games with a goal and an assist, leading the Chicago Blackhawks to a 3-1 victory over the Colorado Avalanche. Goalie Petr Mrazek made 35 saves, earning his first win since returning from injury, while Colorado's Mikko Rantanen and Nathan MacKinnon had their respective point streaks ended. Juuso Parssinen scored first for the Avalanche, while Frank Nazar and Ilya Mikheyev netted goals for the Blackhawks, with Nazareth's goal marking his first of the season. An apparent Bedard goal was overturned due to a distinct kicking motion, but he later scored to make it 3-1. Bedard tied Patrick Kane for the second-most assists by a teenager in Blackhawks history and matched Eddie Olczyk and Bobby Hull for the team's third-longest point streak by a teenager.
