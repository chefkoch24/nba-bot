**New Jersey Devils 3 - 1 Florida Panthers**  
Sam Reinhart scored twice as the Florida Panthers secured their first win of the season with a 4-3 victory over the New Jersey Devils at the Prudential Center. Reinhart’s performance included his 200th NHL goal, while Carter Verhaeghe and Niko Mikkola also contributed to Florida's 4-0 lead. Matthew Tkachuk provided two assists, showcasing his playmaking ability. Despite New Jersey's spirited comeback attempt, with goals from Jesper Bratt, Erik Haula, and Michael McLeod making it a close contest, Florida held firm with key defensive plays, including 20 blocked shots and 31 saves by Sergei Bobrovsky. Panthers coach Paul Maurice praised the team’s gritty performance and was encouraged as they head into their home opener against the Toronto Maple Leafs. Notably, Bobrovsky tied for second in franchise history with 106 wins, while Florida forward Justin Sourdif made his NHL debut.
