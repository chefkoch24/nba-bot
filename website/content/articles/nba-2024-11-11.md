**Detroit Pistons 99 - 101 Houston Rockets**  
In a nail-biting finish, the Houston Rockets edged out the Detroit Pistons with a 101-99 victory, primarily propelled by Alperen Sengun's contribution of 27 points and 10 rebounds. Sengun's critical five points in the final minutes proved decisive, and his putback gave the Rockets a late lead. A dramatic final sequence saw Pistons guard Cade Cunningham intentionally miss a free throw with six seconds remaining, leading to a flurry of rebound attempts and a pivotal foul on Tobias Harris, who missed crucial free throws. Cunningham narrowly missed achieving his fourth consecutive triple-double with 26 points, nine assists, and eight rebounds. Despite the Pistons' impressive rally, including a surge led by Malik Beasley’s three 3-pointers, they fell short as Houston capitalized on offensive rebounds and defensive pressure. The Rockets overcame poor early shooting from beyond the arc through effective rebounding, while the Pistons struggled overall despite Cunningham's strong performance.

**Milwaukee Bucks 107 - 113 Boston Celtics**  
In an impressive comeback, the Boston Celtics overcame a nine-point halftime deficit to defeat the Milwaukee Bucks 113-107, led by Jayson Tatum's 31 points, 12 rebounds, and six assists. Tatum's two clutch free throws with 5:51 remaining secured Boston's lead, marking a pivotal turning point in the game. Although Giannis Antetokounmpo delivered a standout performance with a season-high 43 points, 13 rebounds, and five assists for the Bucks, it wasn't enough to snap Milwaukee's losing streak, now sitting at eight out of nine games. The Celtics' Payton Pritchard significantly contributed by scoring 17 of his 18 points in the first half, helping to maintain Boston's competitiveness. After trailing 69-58 at halftime, Boston surged in the third quarter with a 12-0 run, marked by an Al Horford 3-pointer, while Milwaukee struggled, scoring just 15 points in that quarter. Despite eight ties and seven lead changes in the second half, Boston consistently countered Milwaukee's rallies. Meanwhile, Damian Lillard had a challenging game, scoring 14 points and hitting only one out of eight attempts from beyond the arc. With this victory, Boston will face the Atlanta Hawks next, while the Bucks aim to regain form against the Toronto Raptors.

The Golden State Warriors overcame a late challenge to defeat the Oklahoma City Thunder 127-116, with Stephen Curry leading the charge with 36 points, including seven 3-pointers. Curry's performance was a reminder of his prowess, especially notable in a game where the Warriors shot over 50% from the field for the first time against the Thunder this season. The Thunder's evening was marred by Chet Holmgren's early exit due to a hip injury, which affected their defensive capabilities, particularly around the rim. Jonathan Kuminga, De’Anthony Melton, and Andrew Wiggins also contributed significantly to the Warriors' offense, while Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Jalen Williams tried to keep the Thunder in contention. Despite a late surge that saw their deficit cut to six, the Thunder fell short and suffered their first home loss.

Despite a strong challenge from Dallas, led by Kyrie Irving's season-high 43 points and Luka Doncic's 24 points, the Mavericks narrowly fell short. Dallas staged a significant comeback after being down by 10 points in the first quarter, and Irving's three consecutive three-pointers in the final period gave his team a brief lead. However, Jokic's crucial tip-in set the stage for Porter's game-winner, with Irving missing a potential game-winning three-pointer at the buzzer. Both teams had all starting players score in double figures in a game marked by Denver's effective 3-point shooting at 48.3%.
