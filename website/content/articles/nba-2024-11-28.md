**Charlotte Hornets 94 - 98 Miami Heat**  
In a closely contested game, the Miami Heat edged out the Charlotte Hornets 98-94, with Tyler Herro leading the Heat with 27 points and a crucial late-game steal. Duncan Robinson also contributed significantly with 22 points, including six 3-pointers, as the Heat rebounded from their previous night's loss to the Milwaukee Bucks. Bam Adebayo was instrumental on both ends, recording 10 rebounds and 10 assists. Despite a valiant effort from LaMelo Ball, who scored 32 points while battling a wrist injury, the Hornets fell just short, losing their fifth game in six outings. Rookie Tidjane Salaun's career-high 17 points highlighted Charlotte's rally from a 20-point deficit, culminating in a brief lead with 42 seconds remaining. However, Herro's timely 3-pointer and steal, coupled with Cody Martin's missed free throws, dashed the Hornets' hopes. Miami managed to secure victory even as Jimmy Butler exited the game in the third quarter with a back issue. The Heat look to build on this win against the Raptors next, while the Hornets face the Knicks.

**Dallas Mavericks 129 - 114 New York Knicks**  
In an impressive display by Kyrie Irving and the Dallas Mavericks, they cruised to a 129-114 victory over the New York Knicks, advancing to a 4-1 record without their superstar Luka Doncic, who missed his fourth consecutive game due to a sprained right wrist. With Jalen Brunson matching his season-high of 37 points in his return to Dallas, Karl-Anthony Towns contributed 25 points and 14 rebounds for the Knicks, but OG Anunoby was unusually quiet, tallying just eight points. Throughout the game, Naji Marshall, Spencer Dinwiddie, and P.J. Washington each posted significant points for Dallas, who were also missing key players Klay Thompson and Daniel Gafford. Another highlight was NFL legend Tom Brady making a courtside appearance, drawing attention from the audience.

The Knicks, meanwhile, set a season low for any quarter with just 15 points after a triumphant high against Denver earlier in the week.

**Golden State Warriors 101 - 105 Oklahoma City Thunder**  
The Oklahoma City Thunder aim to avenge their previous loss to the Golden State Warriors as they clash again, now boosted by the return of Isaiah Hartenstein, a key acquisition filling the team's need for an interior force. Hartenstein's impressive debut with double-doubles in consecutive wins adds hope to a Thunder team missing Chet Holmgren due to injury. The Warriors, on the other hand, will miss Stephen Curry, sidelined with knee pain, potentially affecting their performance. Curry previously scored 36 points against the Thunder, leading the Warriors to a 127-116 victory. De'Anthony Melton, who started for the Warriors in Curry’s absence, contributed a double-double, but he is likely out for the season due to injury. Amidst their struggle with a losing streak and energy lag reflected in recent blown leads, the Warriors seek a resurgence following their upcoming break. Both teams may be missing additional key players as the Thunder's Alex Caruso is out and the Warriors' Jonathan Kuminga is questionable for the upcoming match.
