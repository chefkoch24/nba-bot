**Philadelphia 76ers 125 - 113 Orlando Magic**  
Joel Embiid returned from an injury scare to score 32 points, leading the Philadelphia 76ers to a 125-113 victory over the Orlando Magic. Tyrese Maxey added 28 points and Kelly Oubre Jr. contributed 21 as the Sixers won their seventh consecutive game. Orlando, Indiana, and Philadelphia are all tied with a record of 46-35 in the Eastern Conference playoff seedings. Despite a strong performance from Franz Wagner, Paolo Banchero, and Jalen Suggs, the Magic couldn't overcome the early deficit and suffered their third straight loss. Embiid's return had a significant impact on the game, and although he briefly left the court with a knee issue, he came back and hit a 3-pointer in the second half. The win secured a season series sweep for Philadelphia over Orlando, but their playoff seeding will depend on the outcome of their final game against Brooklyn and other results in the conference.

**Boston Celtics 131 - 98 Charlotte Hornets**  
Payton Pritchard led the Boston Celtics to a 131-98 win over the Charlotte Hornets with a career-high 31 points and 11 assists, while top Celtics starters rested. The win helped the Celtics avoid a three-game losing streak for the first time in over a decade. Pritchard's performance showcased his growth and versatility this season, as he looks to play in all 82 regular-season games for the first time in his career. The Hornets, already eliminated from playoff contention, were missing key players and struggled against the Celtics' depth. Boston will face the Washington Wizards in their regular-season finale, likely giving more playing time to their bench players.
