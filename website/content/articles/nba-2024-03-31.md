**New Orleans Pelicans 92 - 104 Boston Celtics**  
Jayson Tatum scored 23 points as the Celtics bounced back from back-to-back losses with a 104-92 win over the Pelicans, improving their record to 58-16. Kristaps Porzingis had 19 points, 10 rebounds, and four blocks, while Jaylen Brown added 17 points. Boston dominated in the third quarter, limiting New Orleans to 11 points, and Porzingis played a crucial role in their defensive strategy. The Pelicans struggled in the second half, shooting 4 of 23 in the third quarter, as Boston controlled the game. Zion Williamson scored 25 points for New Orleans, but it wasn't enough to overcome the Celtics' strong performance.

**Orlando Magic 118 - 88 Memphis Grizzlies**  
The Orlando Magic snapped a three-game losing streak with a dominant 118-88 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies, led by Wendell Carter Jr.'s double-double and strong performances from Jalen Suggs and Cole Anthony. Paolo Banchero sat out the fourth quarter after a solid game, and the Magic had nine players hit at least one 3-pointer as they shot 22 for 44 from behind the arc. The win moved the Magic closer to the fourth playoff spot in the Eastern Conference, while the Grizzlies struggled offensively throughout the game, shooting just 26.2% in the first half. Orlando's strong defensive effort and balanced scoring helped them secure the victory and regain their confidence after recent losses.
