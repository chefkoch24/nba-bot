**Charlotte Hornets 112 - 114 Indiana Pacers**  
Rick Carlisle achieved his 1,000th career win as an NBA coach when the Indiana Pacers narrowly defeated the Charlotte Hornets 114-112, ending a 13-game losing streak. Pascal Siakam stood out with 30 points and 14 rebounds, including a critical driving layup with 11.5 seconds remaining. Indiana's T.J. McConnell contributed 23 points and eight assists, while Aaron Nesmith added 16 points. In a valiant effort for the Hornets, LaMelo Ball, who came off the bench for the first time since early 2021, tallied 33 points and eight assists, making seven 3-pointers. Despite a chance to tie the game in the final seconds, the Hornets missed a crucial jump shot and failed to secure the rebound. Notably, Charlotte coach Charles Lee chose not to start Ball, resting him due to ankle concerns, while Brandon Miller was ejected early in the third quarter. The game marked the second straight night the Hornets suffered a tight home loss, following a buzzer-beater defeat to Toronto.

**Minnesota Timberwolves 131 - 122 Cleveland Cavaliers**  
The Minnesota Timberwolves secured their fourth consecutive victory by defeating the Cleveland Cavaliers 131-122, driven by Julius Randle's impressive performance with 28 points, 11 rebounds, and eight assists. Notably, Anthony Edwards scored 25 points, nine assists, and seven rebounds, becoming the third-youngest player in NBA history to reach 10,000 career points—a milestone only achieved by LeBron James and Kevin Durant at a younger age. Edwards’ notable moment came with a 13-foot fadeaway jumper in the fourth quarter. The Timberwolves built their lead with a 43-22 third-quarter surge, largely thanks to Randle's 13 points during that period. Jaden McDaniels contributed 26 points while Donte DiVincenzo added 22 points, shooting 6-for-10 from beyond the arc. Minnesota's record of 15-5 since Thanksgiving is the best in the league over this span. The team also recorded season highs in overall and three-point shooting percentages. Despite Donovan Mitchell's 30 points for the Cavaliers, the Timberwolves successfully held off a late-game surge. The game began with a moment of silence for Renee Good, victim of a recent shooting incident. The two teams are set to face off again on Saturday in Cleveland.

The Utah Jazz ended their five-game losing streak with a narrow 116-114 victory over the Dallas Mavericks, highlighted by Lauri Markkanen’s impressive performance, scoring 33 points and grabbing seven rebounds. Utah capitalized on Dallas’ mistakes, scoring 25 points off 21 turnovers and dominating the paint with a 64-46 advantage. Keyonte George contributed 19 points and seven assists, while Kevin Love had a double-double with 10 points and 10 rebounds. For Dallas, Cooper Flagg led with 29 points, 10 rebounds, and eight assists, supported by Klay Thompson’s 23 points off the bench. Despite Dallas taking a late 107-100 lead, Utah’s defense stepped up, and Markkanen led a pivotal 12-0 run to reclaim the lead in the closing minutes. The Jazz’s aggressiveness was evident from the start, scoring 24 of their 34 first-quarter points in the paint and building a significant lead early on. Cody Williams energized Utah with three dunks over four possessions during a critical run, and the Jazz held off a strong Mavericks comeback to secure the win.
