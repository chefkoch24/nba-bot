Despite Bilal Coulibaly's opening basket giving the Wizards an early lead, Toronto quickly responded with an 11-point run and maintained control throughout, leading 105-77 at the end of three quarters.

**Phoenix Suns 114 - 113 Minnesota Timberwolves**  
In a dramatic finish, the Phoenix Suns rallied in the final minute to defeat the Minnesota Timberwolves 114-113, highlighted by Collin Gillespie's go-ahead jumper with 6.4 seconds remaining. Despite Minnesota's commanding 113-105 lead with just over a minute left, Phoenix clawed back, with Jordan Goodwin's layup narrowing the gap before Anthony Edwards, who scored 41 points, missed two critical free throws. Gillespie capitalized with his decisive shot, adding to his 20-point contribution. The Timberwolves' last-gasp effort ended with Julius Randle's missed 3-pointer at the buzzer. Edwards was instrumental in overcoming a 15-point halftime deficit, particularly with his 19-point third quarter. However, the Suns, overcoming a tough night for star Devin Booker—who struggled with 16 points, nine turnovers, and fouled out—prevailed. Despite Booker's issues, including a technical foul, Dillon Brooks led with 22 points before also fouling out.

The Rockets secured a 114-104 victory over the Cavaliers, with Alperen Sengun leading the charge with 28 points, 11 rebounds, and seven assists.

Meanwhile, the Nuggets bounced back from a previous loss with a 125-118 win over the Pelicans. Nikola Jokic recorded another triple-double, while Peyton Watson scored a career-high 32 points. However, Denver's victory wasn't flawless, as they struggled with turnovers, notably conceding 24 points on 20 errors, a concern addressed by coach David Adelman. Both Houston and Denver now prepare for a key NBA Cup matchup, each holding a 1-1 record in their group and vying closely in the Western Conference standings.

**Golden State Warriors 123 - 127 Portland Trail Blazers**  
The Golden State Warriors are set to embark on a five-game homestand, beginning with a critical NBA Cup rematch against the visiting Portland Trail Blazers. Having recently completed a grueling nine-day, six-game road trip, the Warriors aim to capitalize on rested key players like Stephen Curry and Draymond Green, who were given time off during a prior loss to Miami. As they look to improve their .500 Cup record, Golden State is poised to welcome back Jonathan Kuminga from injury. On the flip side, the Trail Blazers, under interim coach Tiago Splitter following Chauncey Billups' suspension, are grappling with significant roster challenges. Without star Damian Lillard this season due to surgery and missing several key players like Scoot Henderson and Matisse Thybulle due to injuries, Portland has struggled, dropping seven of their last nine games. Despite their setbacks, they aim to rally from close heartbreak defeats, including a recent buzzer-beater loss against the Chicago Bulls, as they continue their road journey.
