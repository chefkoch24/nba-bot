**Oklahoma City Thunder 118 - 103 Minnesota Timberwolves**  
In a commanding performance, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Oklahoma City Thunder to a 118-103 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves, giving them a 2-0 lead in the Western Conference finals. Fresh off being named the NBA's MVP, Gilgeous-Alexander scored 38 points, making 12 of 21 field goals and 13 of 15 free throws, while also contributing eight assists and three steals. His efforts were complemented by Jalen Williams, who scored 26 points and grabbed 10 rebounds, and Chet Holmgren's 22 points. Oklahoma City showcased a strong defensive effort, with Lu Dort and Williams receiving all-defensive team honors earlier that day. Despite Minnesota's Anthony Edwards scoring 32 points, it took him 26 shots to reach that mark. Jaden McDaniels and Nickeil Walker-Alexander added 22 and 17 points, respectively, for the Timberwolves. Notable plays included Gilgeous-Alexander's three-pointer and crucial free throws just before halftime, as well as a highlight-reel play where he scored a wild shot while being fouled by his cousin, Nickeil Alexander-Walker. The Thunder will look to extend their series lead in Game 3, set for Saturday in Minneapolis.
