**Indiana Pacers 104 - 126 Cleveland Cavaliers**  
In a crucial Game 3 victory, the Cleveland Cavaliers, led by Donovan Mitchell's 43-point performance, defeated the Indiana Pacers 126-104 to cut their semifinal series deficit to 2-1. Despite a physical game marked by frequent floor collisions and five technical fouls against Indiana, Cleveland maintained control after a 25-4 run transformed a tied game into a 21-point halftime lead. Mitchell, refusing to let another fourth-quarter lead slip away, delivered key shots and assisted Max Strus, who scored 20 points, to fend off a Pacers comeback. Cleveland also welcomed back key players Evan Mobley and Darius Garland from injuries, contributing to their successful defensive and rebounding efforts. Indianaâ€™s home court advantage was nullified as Tyrese Haliburton experienced his first career postseason home loss, with Pacers coach Rick Carlisle admitting his team was poorly prepared. The road team has won all three games in the series, and Indiana will try again to stop this trend in Game 4.

**Denver Nuggets 113 - 104 Oklahoma City Thunder**  
In a thrilling turn of events, the Oklahoma City Thunder rebounded from a disappointing Game 1 loss to the Denver Nuggets by delivering a dominant 43-point victory in Game 2, evening their Western Conference quarterfinal series. The Thunder's explosive start in the second game saw them leading by 24 points after the first quarter and building a staggering 49-point advantage, showcasing their ability to perform under pressure. This shift in momentum now takes the series to Denver for the next two games. Oklahoma City has been strong on the road, with a 32-8 away record during the regular season and early playoff success, which positions them well to reclaim home-court advantage. Their aggressive strategy effectively contained Nuggets star Nikola Jokic, who was hindered to just 17 points after a dominant Game 1 performance. Denver struggled overall, shooting poorly and committing numerous turnovers but will rely on their championship experience to recover. Meanwhile, injury concerns for Denver linger with Michael Porter Jr.'s shoulder sprain, while Russell Westbrook sees increased playtime. The upcoming Game 3 on Friday promises to be a critical and hard-fought contest.
