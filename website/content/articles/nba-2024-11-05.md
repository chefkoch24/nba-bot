**Houston Rockets 109 - 97 New York Knicks**  
The Houston Rockets secured a 109-97 win against the New York Knicks, thanks largely to Alperen Sengun's impressive 25 points and 14 rebounds. Despite the Rockets’ early 15-point lead, the Knicks narrowed the gap to just one point late in the fourth quarter. However, Sengun, who was closely guarded by Karl-Anthony Towns, managed to score 10 crucial points in the final period. Fred VanVleet contributed 19 points, while Jalen Green added 15 to bolster Houston's effort. The Knicks’ Jalen Brunson led all scorers with 29 points, and OG Anunoby added 21, but the team was outscored 62-38 in the paint. Towns contributed 17 points and grabbed a season-high 19 rebounds but couldn't steer New York to victory, ending their two-game win streak. The Rockets focused on involving multiple players, with four starters in double figures and Amen Thompson adding 12 points off the bench. Nonetheless, their inconsistency remains a challenge, as they blew a double-digit lead before reclaiming control, a pattern seen in their previous overtime loss to the Warriors. Key plays included a decisive dunk by Thompson and a timely 3-pointer from Green, sealing the win despite Houston’s struggles from beyond the arc, making only 8 of 33 attempts. The game highlighted Houston's need for consistency and New York's struggles with inside scoring. The Knicks will visit the Hawks next, while the Rockets will welcome the Spurs.

**Phoenix Suns 118 - 116 Philadelphia 76ers**  
The Phoenix Suns are experiencing a quick start under new coach Mike Budenholzer, winning their last four games and five of six overall going into Monday's game against the struggling Philadelphia 76ers, who are playing without their stars, Joel Embiid and Paul George, due to left knee injuries. Philadelphia has lost four of five games to begin the season, facing additional drama after Embiid, who is rehabbing a knee surgery from February and defending his commitment to the team, had a contentious exchange with a reporter critical of him. Meanwhile, George, a recent high-profile addition to the 76ers and recovering from a preseason knee injury, is set to potentially make his debut against the Suns. The Suns' recent victory over the Portland Trail Blazers showcased a powerful third-quarter performance, highlighted by Devin Booker's nearly triple-double effort and Grayson Allen's impactful play off the bench. As Philadelphia awaits the return of their key players, Phoenix capitalized on their opponent's weaknesses, signaling a strong early season form.

**LA Clippers 113 - 104 San Antonio Spurs**  
The Los Angeles Clippers are struggling to find their footing in their new $2 billion arena, opening the season 0-4 at home, most recently losing 105-92 to the Oklahoma City Thunder. Despite leading at halftime, they faltered in the second half, a recurring issue in their home games, contributing to their poor start. Norman Powell has emerged as the Clippers' scoring leader in the absence of Kawhi Leonard, averaging 25.2 points per game. Head coach Tyronn Lue highlighted the need for offensive improvement. Meanwhile, the San Antonio Spurs travel to Los Angeles with a two-game winning streak, after defeating the Minnesota Timberwolves 113-103, guided by assistant coach Mitch Johnson due to Gregg Popovich's illness. Keldon Johnson, Jeremy Sochan, and rookie Victor Wembanyama led the scoring for the Spurs, who are also benefiting from veteran Chris Paul's playmaking. Paul, eager to see the Clippers' new arena where he once played, recorded double-digit assists in consecutive games, making him the second-oldest to do so after John Stockton.
