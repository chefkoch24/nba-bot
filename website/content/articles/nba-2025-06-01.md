**Indiana Pacers 125 - 108 New York Knicks**  
The Indiana Pacers punched their ticket to the NBA Finals for the second time in franchise history after defeating the New York Knicks 125-108 in Game 6. Pascal Siakam led with 31 points, while Tyrese Haliburton contributed 21 points and 13 assists. Obi Toppin, facing his former team, added 18 points and six rebounds, receiving a standing ovation when the Pacers' starters left the court. The Pacers' intense defense forced the Knicks into 17 turnovers, with OG Anunoby leading New York with 24 points. The game was physical from the start, exemplified by Karl-Anthony Towns limping after a foul and Haliburton taking a hit that sent him to the ground. Indiana broke open the game in the second half with a 9-0 run, highlighted by three consecutive 3-pointers, extending their lead and maintaining control despite the Knicks' efforts to catch up. The crowd included notable figures such as Colts quarterback Anthony Richardson and WNBA star Caitlin Clark. Despite the Knicks' ambition to overcome a 3-1 series deficit and their prolonged championship drought since 1973, the Pacers sealed their path to face Oklahoma City in the Finals, with Reggie Miller, a member of Indiana's 1999-2000 Finals team, providing commentary for TNT.
