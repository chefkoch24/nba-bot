Cade Cunningham's stellar performance, scoring 36 points, led the Detroit Pistons to a thrilling 124-119 road victory over the New York Knicks, marking their second consecutive win against the Knicks after a 16-game losing streak.

However, it was Malik Beasley who sealed the win with two crucial 3-pointers in the final 40 seconds, contributing to his 22-point tally and shooting 6 for 8 from beyond the arc. Jalen Brunson put up a strong effort for the Knicks with 31 points and 11 assists despite a recent shoulder injury, while Mikal Bridges and Karl-Anthony Towns added significant contributions. The Pistons continue their hot streak, having won 10 of their last 12 games, as they prepare to host Indiana on Thursday. Meanwhile, the Knicks, effective offensively with 50% shooting from the field, will aim to bounce back during their upcoming game in Philadelphia.

Chris Boucher was a key contributor, scoring 17 of his 18 points in the fourth quarter and assisting Agbaji's crucial fast-break dunk. On the other side, Stephen Curry topped the Warriors' effort with 26 points, while Andrew Wiggins added 20. Buddy Hield's attempt to force overtime with a 3-pointer fell short, as the Warriors, missing Draymond Green due to illness, suffered their second consecutive defeat.

**Houston Rockets 120 - 118 Memphis Grizzlies**  
In a thrilling showdown, the Houston Rockets edged out the Memphis Grizzlies 120-118, thanks to Jalen Green's stellar performance, equaling his career-high of 42 points. Green's crucial late-game layup put the Rockets ahead, and Amen Thompson's pair of free throws extended their lead. Despite Ja Morant's impressive 29-point effort, including a 38-footer that once led the Grizzlies by 12, Memphis faltered in the final minutes. The Rockets' 16-2 scoring spree turned the tide, supported by Fred VanVleet and Jalen Green's vital three-pointers. Houston's 15 offensive rebounds highlighted their resurgence and marked their fourth consecutive win. The Grizzlies will look to bounce back as they face San Antonio, while the Rockets prepare to challenge Denver next.

**Los Angeles Lakers 102 - 126 San Antonio Spurs**  
After a pause due to deadly wildfires in Southern California, the Los Angeles Lakers are set to resume their schedule against the San Antonio Spurs on Monday. The wildfires, responsible for destroying around 12,000 structures and causing 24 deaths, led to the postponement of two Lakers home games, including one against the Charlotte Hornets. Lakers head coach JJ Redick's home was among those lost to the fires. Despite these challenges, Redick praised the organization for their support during this difficult time. The Lakers, who are on a two-game losing streak, will look to turn things around, with extra days of rest benefiting veterans Anthony Davis and LeBron James. The Spurs, meanwhile, also aim to end their own three-game skid, having last lost to the Milwaukee Bucks. In previous encounters this season, the Lakers defeated the Spurs both times, with standout performances from Davis. Saturday's postponed game between the teams remains unscheduled.

**LA Clippers 109 - 98 Miami Heat**  
In a game shadowed by the devastating wildfires impacting Los Angeles, the Clippers aim to uplift their city as they host the Miami Heat. The wildfires, described as the most destructive in the city's history, have led to at least 24 deaths and widespread evacuations, affecting Clippers star Kawhi Leonard, who missed a game to ensure his family's safety. Despite the chaos, the Heat continue their strong form on a six-game western tour, recently dominating Portland with Tyler Herro scoring 32 points. Herro and coach Erik Spoelstra expressed solidarity with those affected by the wildfires, underlining the broader context beyond basketball. Meanwhile, Miami remains resilient, managing a successful run even without their suspended star, Jimmy Butler. This matchup marks the teams' first meeting this season, with the Clippers having won both encounters last year.
