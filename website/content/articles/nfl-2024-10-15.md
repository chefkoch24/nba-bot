**New York Jets 20 - 23 Buffalo Bills**  
In a thrilling game full of dramatic moments, Josh Allen led the Buffalo Bills to a narrow 23-20 victory over the New York Jets, securing their lead in the AFC East. Despite a remarkable Hail Mary touchdown pass from Aaron Rodgers to Allen Lazard at the end of the first half, the Jets fell short after Greg Zuerlein missed two crucial field goals. This loss marked the Jets' third in a row amid a week of coaching upheaval. Allen showcased his dual-threat ability by throwing two touchdown passes and running for another score, while also leading a game-winning drive capped by Tyler Bass's 22-yard field goal. The Bills capitalized despite a high penalty count and managed to hold on in the final minutes when Taron Johnson intercepted a deep pass intended for Mike Williams. For the Jets, Rodgers threw for 294 yards with two touchdowns but couldn't overcome the team's struggles, including missed opportunities and crucial penalties. Rookie Ray Davis stepped up for Buffalo, rushing for 97 yards in place of the injured James Cook. The game ended with the Bills running out the clock, solidifying their position as the only AFC East team with a winning record.
