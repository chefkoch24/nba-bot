**New York Jets 20 - 23 Buffalo Bills**  
In an exciting Monday night clash, the Buffalo Bills edged out the New York Jets 23-20, solidifying their lead in the AFC East. The game saw Josh Allen shine with two touchdown passes and a rushing score, while rookie Ray Davis impressed with 97 rushing yards. Despite Aaron Rodgers' stunning Hail Mary to end the first half, the Jets couldn't overcome their struggles, marking their third consecutive loss amid coaching turmoil. Key moments included Jets kicker Greg Zuerlein missing two critical field goals after hitting the upright both times, and Allen's clutch 22-yard field goal late in the fourth quarter. The game was marred by penalties, with each team amassing 11 flags, and notable performances included Breece Hall's rushing and receiving yards for the Jets. A crucial interception by Taron Johnson in the dying moments helped the Bills maintain control as they hope to avoid a three-game skid with Allen at the helm for the first time.
