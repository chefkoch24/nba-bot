**Minnesota Timberwolves 117 - 93 Golden State Warriors**  
In a game marked by Stephen Curry's absence, the Minnesota Timberwolves secured a 117-93 victory over the Golden State Warriors, leveling the second-round playoff series at 1-1. Julius Randle shone for the Timberwolves with 24 points and 11 assists, while Anthony Edwards added 20 points despite an injury scare. Capitalizing on Curry's absence due to a hamstring strain, the Wolves significantly improved their 3-point shooting performance, making 16 of 37 attempts. The Warriors struggled offensively, starting the game with a five-minute scoring drought and recording their lowest first-quarter playoff score since the 2016 NBA Finals. Jonathan Kuminga provided a spark off the bench, scoring 18 points, but the Warriors' offense fell flat without Curry. Notably, Draymond Green received his fifth technical foul of the playoffs, prompting Curry to intervene to prevent an ejection.
