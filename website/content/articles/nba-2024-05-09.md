**New York Knicks 130 - 121 Indiana Pacers**  
Jalen Brunson returned from a foot injury to lead the New York Knicks to a 130-121 victory over the Indiana Pacers, giving the Knicks a 2-0 lead in the Eastern Conference semifinals. The Madison Square Garden crowd chanted "MVP!" as Brunson scored 29 points in the win, falling just short of becoming the second player in NBA history to score 40+ points in five straight playoff games. Despite losing key players to injuries, the Knicks relied on Brunson and his Villanova teammates, Donte DiVincenzo and Josh Hart, for a strong performance. Tyrese Haliburton led the Pacers with 34 points, but the Knicks outlasted them, prompting complaints from Pacers coach Rick Carlisle about officiating. The series now moves to Indiana for Game 3.
