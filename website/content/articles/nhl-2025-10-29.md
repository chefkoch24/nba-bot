**Vancouver Canucks 0 - 2 New York Rangers**  
Miller scores in OT, Rangers edge Canucks
 **VANCOUVER --** <forge-entity title="K&#39;Andre Miller" slug="k-andre-miller-8480817" code="player">K&#39;Andre Miller</forge-entity> scored at 3:48 of overtime to give the New York Rangers a 4-3 win against the Vancouver Canucks at Rogers Arena on Saturday. 
Miller scored with a one-timer from the right face-off dot off a cross-ice pass from <forge-entity title="Chris Kreider" slug="chris-kreider-8475184" code="player">Chris Kreider</forge-entity> on a 3-on-1 rush. It was his first goal of the season.

“It's always good to get the first one out of the way,” Miller said. “We're really starting to get our stride and really starting to figure out our systems and it's all come into play, and we're feeling really good about ourselves.”

<forge-entity title="Mika Zibanejad" slug="mika-zibanejad-8476459" code="player">Mika Zibanejad</forge-entity> also scored his first goal of the season and had two assists for the Rangers (6-2-0), who have won the first four games of a five-game road trip that will conclude at the Winnipeg Jets on Monday.

“Yeah, I'm not going to lie,” Zibanejad said when asked if he’d been frustrated by not scoring. “Frustrating from the chances that have been there and how close it's been, but it's a lot a lot easier to deal with when the team is winning.” 
<forge-entity title="Artemi Panarin" slug="artemi-panarin-8478550" code="player">Artemi Panarin</forge-entity> and <forge-entity title="Adam Fox" slug="adam-fox-8479323" code="player">Adam Fox</forge-entity> each had a goal and an assist, and <forge-entity title="Igor Shesterkin" slug="igor-shesterkin-8478048" code="player">Igor Shesterkin</forge-entity> made 30 saves, including six in overtime, highlighted by consecutive stops against <forge-entity title="Andrei Kuzmenko" slug="andrei-kuzmenko-8483808" code="player">Andrei Kuzmenko</forge-entity> on an individual rush through the slot at 2:21.

“'Shesty' made a couple of unbelievable saves,” Miller said.

<forge-entity title="Filip Hronek" slug="filip-hronek-8479425" code="player">Filip Hronek</forge-entity> had two assists and <forge-entity title="Casey DeSmith" slug="casey-desmith-8479193" code="player">Casey DeSmith</forge-entity> made 20 saves for the Canucks (5-2-1), who had their winning streak end at three.

"On a back-to-back usually we come out flat,” Vancouver defenseman <forge-entity title="Quinn Hughes" slug="quinn-hughes-8480800" code="player">Quinn Hughes</forge-entity> said. “When we get tired in the second or third, mistakes kick in. There was none of that. I thought we were, you know, pretty solid tonight. It’s a good team over there."

Panarin put the Rangers ahead 1-0 at 9:18 of the first period with a wrist shot through traffic during a 5-on-3 power play. Panarin leads New York with 12 points (four goals, eight assists) and has a point in all eight games this season, which is tied for the longest season-opening point streak by a Rangers player since Rod Gilbert’s nine-game streak in 1971-72.

New York finished 3-for-5 on the power play and is second in the NHL on the man-advantage at 34.5 percent.

“We've played together for some time and when things are clicking, when you're scoring, obviously you get confidence from that,” Zibanejad said of the power play. “We know what we're capable of doing and just got to keep going.” 
<forge-entity title="J.T. Miller" slug="j-t-miller-8476468" code="player">J.T. Miller</forge-entity> tied it 1-1 on a power play with a deflection at 15:57 of the second period.

<forge-entity title="Tyler Myers" slug="tyler-myers-8474574" code="player">Tyler Myers</forge-entity> scored short-handed on a 2-on-1 to put the Canucks ahead 2-1 at 9:06 of the third period. He intercepted a pass at Vancouver's blue line and skated the puck out before lifting a wrist shot over Shesterkin’s glove.

"I thought we played a really solid game tonight as a group.” Myers said. “I didn't think we gave them much. I thought we played very sound structurally, and I thought it was one of our most complete games."

Fox tied it 2-2 at 12:21, redirecting Panarin’s pass over a sprawling DeSmith during another 5-on-3 power play.

On the ensuing 5-on-4 power play, Zibanejad put New York ahead 3-2 at 13:24 when he scored from the left hash marks following a scramble in front.

"A lot of back and forth,” Zibanejad said. “Obviously, giving up one right away on that power play and then coming back and scoring two, that was big for us. It was, I would say, a crazy third period. Probably fun to watch and nice one to win."

<forge-entity title="Carson Soucy" slug="carson-soucy-8477369" code="player">Carson Soucy</forge-entity> tied it 3-3 at 15:42 with a shot from the point through traffic.

"We’ve got a resilient group,” Hughes said.

Rangers coach Peter Laviolete said the same about his team.

“I do think there was good resilience. We had to climb back from being down and then even being tied up late,” he said. “Good ending for us, but it's just a night that was dominated by special teams and kind of some odd stuff that we had to deal with throughout the course of the game, but I liked the fact that we stayed in it and kept battling.”

**NOTES:** Rangers forward <forge-entity title="Barclay Goodrow" slug="barclay-goodrow-8476624" code="player">Barclay Goodrow</forge-entity> played his 500th NHL game. … Fox has five points (two goals, three assists) during a three-game point streak. … Hronek has four assists during a three-game point streak.
