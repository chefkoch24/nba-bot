**Philadelphia Flyers 3 - 4 Montreal Canadiens**  
The Montreal Canadiens, led by Nick Suzuki and Brendan Gallagher, secured a 4-3 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers, marking their second consecutive win following a previous victory against the St. Louis Blues. Notably, Aleksei Kolosov became the first Belarusian goalie to play in the NHL, making 20 saves during his debut. Montreal's pivotal second period saw them score three goals, with Gallagher breaking a seven-game point drought, despite what he considered not one of his better games. Philadelphia, enduring their seventh loss in eight games, attempted a comeback with late goals from Travis Sanheim and Travis Konecny but ultimately fell short. Suzuki continued his impressive form by extending his point streak to seven games, joining an elite group of Canadiens players with multiple seven-game streaks at a young age, enhancing the team's morale and showcasing their potential to improve further as the season progresses.

In a thrilling matchup at Ball Arena, the Colorado Avalanche narrowly defeated the Ottawa Senators 5-4, securing their fifth consecutive victory. Casey Mittelstadt stood out with three assists, contributing to goals by Nikolai Kovalenko, Josh Manson, Logan O'Connor, Ross Colton, and Nathan MacKinnon, the latter of whom extended his season-opening point streak to nine games alongside Cale Makar. Kovalenko notched his first NHL goal, while Justus Annunen recorded 26 saves for Colorado.
