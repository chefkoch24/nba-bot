**Buffalo Bills 34 - 10 Tennessee Titans**  
In a commanding 34-10 victory over the Tennessee Titans, Amari Cooper made an impactful debut for the Buffalo Bills, scoring a go-ahead touchdown shortly after joining the team from the Cleveland Browns. Despite limited practice, Cooper quickly adapted to quarterback Josh Allen's play-calling, contributing to the Bills' offensive success and helping fellow receiver Keon Coleman surpass 100 receiving yards for the first time this season. Allen marked his 100th career start, overcoming a slow first half to finish with 323 yards and two touchdowns, improving his record to 68-32 and joining an elite group of quarterbacks with similar early-career success. The Bills shook off a 10-0 deficit with additional touchdowns from James Cook and Ray Davis, while the struggling Titans fell to a 1-5 start, hindered by penalties and ineffective offensive adjustments despite backup quarterback Mason Rudolph stepping in for the injured Will Levis. The game turned in Buffalo's favor early in the second half when their defense thwarted a crucial Titans drive, laying the groundwork for their dominant performance. With Cooper contributing four catches for 66 yards, his arrival has clearly energized an already potent Bills offense.

**Washington Commanders 40 - 7 Carolina Panthers**  
The Washington Commanders overcame the early loss of rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels to a rib injury and secured a resounding 40-7 victory over the Carolina Panthers. Backup QB Marcus Mariota stepped in and effectively led the team, completing 18 of 23 passes for 205 yards and throwing touchdown passes to Zach Ertz and Ben Sinnott. The Commanders' defense was dominant, highlighted by Dante Fowler's 67-yard interception return for a touchdown and limiting the Panthers to just 180 yards. The Panthers struggled defensively, allowing Washington to amass 421 yards and continuing a tough season with a 1-6 record. Andy Dalton, who remained Carolina’s starting quarterback over Bryce Young, had two interceptions, including one to Emmanuel Forbes, who returned after being a healthy scratch. The game also saw Brian Robinson Jr. score in his return from injury, contributing to the Commanders' biggest halftime lead since 2005. The injury woes continued for both teams, with Panthers' Raheem Blackshear and Commanders' rookie LT Brandon Coleman also exiting early. The Commanders improved to 5-2 and will host the Chicago Bears next, while the Panthers will travel to Denver.

**Green Bay Packers 24 - 22 Houston Texans**  
In a thrilling finish, Brandon McManus kicked a 45-yard field goal as time expired to secure a 24-22 victory for the Green Bay Packers over the Houston Texans. Making his Packers debut, McManus celebrated with the iconic "Lambeau leap," marking an exciting chapter after joining the team mid-season. Despite three turnovers, Packers quarterback Jordan Love threw for 214 yards and three touchdowns, helping Green Bay rally from a 19-14 halftime deficit and secure their third consecutive win. Houston's Joe Mixon excelled with 115 rushing yards and two touchdowns, but the Texans struggled in the passing game and were missing several key players due to injuries. The game featured seven lead changes, with Houston briefly leading after Ka’imi Fairbairn’s late field goal. However, Love's late-game drive set up McManus for the decisive kick, reaffirming the team's faith in the veteran kicker despite his tumultuous year.

**Los Angeles Rams 20 - 15 Las Vegas Raiders**  
In a defense-led performance, the Los Angeles Rams capitalized on four turnovers to secure a 20-15 victory over the Las Vegas Raiders. This game marked a turnaround for the Rams' defense, which had struggled in forcing turnovers since Aaron Donald's retirement. Kam Curl's 33-yard fumble return for a touchdown and Kyren Williams' two rushing touchdowns, despite minimal yardage, were key contributors. The Rams took advantage of Aidan O'Connell’s early injury, forcing journeyman quarterback Gardner Minshew into the game, who then committed four turnovers. Jaylen McCollough's late-game interception sealed the Rams' win. Despite a dominant 93-yard performance from rookie tight end Brock Bowers, the Raiders settled for five field goals, struggling in the red zone. The victory improved the Rams' record against the Raiders at SoFi Stadium, maintaining their unbeaten run since the Raiders' return. Meanwhile, Cooper Kupp continued his absence due to injury, but he is expected to return for the Rams' next game against Minnesota.

**New York Giants 3 - 28 Philadelphia Eagles**  
In a dramatic game at MetLife Stadium, Saquon Barkley led the Philadelphia Eagles to a victory over his former team, the New York Giants, with a stellar performance of 176 rushing yards and a touchdown. Despite being jeered upon his return to New York, Barkley's dynamic play turned boos into cheers as he dominated the Giants' defense. Philadelphia's quarterback Jalen Hurts contributed with two quarterback sneaks and a 41-yard touchdown pass, as the Eagles extended their dominance over the Giants with a 28-3 win. The Eagles' defense was equally impressive, sacking Giants’ quarterbacks eight times and restricting them to just 119 yards. Meanwhile, Daniel Jones of the Giants was visibly frustrated after being benched in the fourth quarter, as the Giants continued to struggle at home, remaining winless with just one touchdown scored in four games. The Eagles improved to 4-2 while the Giants fell to 2-5, in a game marked by Barkley's impactful reunion with New York.

**Minnesota Vikings 29 - 31 Detroit Lions**  
In an NFC North thriller, the Detroit Lions edged the previously unbeaten Minnesota Vikings 31-29 with Jake Bates' decisive 44-yard field goal, marking the Vikings' first loss of the season. The Lions executed a thrilling comeback, spurred by Jahmyr Gibbs' 116 rushing yards and two touchdowns, along with stellar quarterback play from Jared Goff, who achieved his third consecutive game with a 140-plus passer rating, joining elite company in NFL history. Despite the Vikings' Ivan Pace Jr. returning a fumble for a touchdown, poorly timed penalties and missed connections between Sam Darnold and Justin Jefferson, including a crucial failed 2-point conversion, hindered the Vikings' efforts. The Lions' victory was their fourth straight against the Vikings, their longest streak since the early 1960s, and showcased a strategic offensive performance against Minnesota’s stout defense. The win keeps the Lions level with the Vikings in the divisional race, while the Green Bay Packers and Chicago Bears remain close behind in a historically competitive NFC North.

The Seattle Seahawks snapped a three-game losing streak with a commanding 34-14 victory over the Atlanta Falcons, driven by a resurgent defensive performance. Derick Hall's 36-yard fumble return for a touchdown was a key highlight, part of three consecutive turnovers forced by the Seahawks in the fourth quarter. Geno Smith contributed two touchdown passes, including a pivotal 31-yard strike to DK Metcalf right before halftime, showcasing the team's balanced offensive and defensive efforts. Despite a difficult day for Atlanta's Kirk Cousins, who was sacked three times and threw two interceptions, rookie quarterback Michael Penix Jr. made his NFL debut for the Falcons. The game was marred by an injury to Seahawks receiver DK Metcalf, who was carted off with a knee injury, though coach Mike Macdonald remains optimistic about his recovery. Meanwhile, Kenneth Walker shone for Seattle with two touchdowns, overcoming a late illness to contribute significantly to the win. Seattle now looks ahead to their home game against the Buffalo Bills, while Atlanta prepares to face the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

**San Francisco 49ers 18 - 28 Kansas City Chiefs**  
In a compelling Super Bowl rematch, the Kansas City Chiefs maintained their undefeated status with a 28-18 victory over the San Francisco 49ers. Despite Patrick Mahomes having a challenging game with two interceptions and no passing touchdowns for the second consecutive match, the Chiefs' defense and running game carried the day. Kansas City ran for a season-high 184 yards and scored four touchdowns on the ground, while their defense secured three interceptions against 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy. Notably, Mahomes made crucial plays with his feet, including a juking 33-yard scramble and a decisive fourth-and-goal rush. Meanwhile, the 49ers suffered a significant blow when star receiver Brandon Aiyuk was carted off with a suspected ACL tear. It was also a poignant moment for Ricky Pearsall, the 49ers rookie receiver, who made his NFL debut 50 days after being shot in a robbery attempt. The game, while less dramatic than their previous Super Bowl clash, reaffirmed Kansas City's dominance over San Francisco, marking their fifth consecutive win against the team.

**Pittsburgh Steelers 37 - 15 New York Jets**  
In his Pittsburgh debut after recovering from a calf injury, Russell Wilson threw for 264 yards and three total touchdowns (two passing, one rushing) to lead the Steelers to a 37-15 victory over the New York Jets. This decision by head coach Mike Tomlin to start Wilson over Justin Fields paid off, solidifying the Steelers' winning momentum with their second consecutive win. The Jets, under interim coach Jeff Ulbrich, have now lost four straight games, despite the recent addition of Davante Adams, who reunited with Aaron Rodgers. Rodgers managed 276 passing yards and a touchdown but was intercepted twice by rookie cornerback Beanie Bishop, transforming those turnovers into crucial points for Pittsburgh. Notably, a packed Acrisure Stadium, which included the presence of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, witnessed the Steelers passing the 30-point mark in consecutive games for the first time since 2020. Despite a strong early start by the Jets, the Steelers overturned the deficit, partly thanks to the efforts of George Pickens and Van Jefferson, to clinch a convincing victory.

Tank Bigsby played a key role, rushing for 118 yards and two touchdowns, while Parker Washington electrified with a 96-yard punt return touchdown. Rookie receiver Brian Thomas Jr. contributed a touchdown catch and pivotal plays leading to scores. Despite Patriots rookie quarterback Drake Maye's effort, including 276 passing yards and two touchdowns, New England lost their sixth consecutive game, a streak unseen since 1993. Post-game, Patriots coach Jerod Mayo criticized his team's performance as "soft," and Jaguars coach Doug Pederson expressed optimism about the win's potential to relieve pressure after a previous demoralizing defeat. The game saw notable attendees like England soccer star Harry Kane, while both teams dealt with injuries, notably Jacksonville's RB Travis Etienne and New England's OL Layden Robinson.

**Cleveland Browns 14 - 21 Cincinnati Bengals**  
In a turbulent AFC North matchup, the Cleveland Browns were defeated 21-14 by the Cincinnati Bengals, further exacerbated by a potentially season-ending Achilles tendon injury to Browns' quarterback Deshaun Watson. His unceremonious collapse, which drew cheers from some Browns fans before the injury's severity was realized, highlighted the division within the fanbase over Watson, whose tenure has been fraught with controversy and injuries. Meanwhile, Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow overcame his Cleveland struggles by throwing two third-quarter touchdowns, aiding Cincinnati's victory and ending their six-game losing streak in Cleveland. Charlie Jones set the tone for the Bengals with a 100-yard kickoff return touchdown. Despite the tumult, the game featured a heartwarming subplot with the return of Browns' running back Nick Chubb, who scored a touchdown in his first game back from a previous knee injury. Browns defensive end Myles Garrett and quarterback Jameis Winston expressed disappointment over the fans' response to Watson's injury, emphasizing sportsmanship and resilience amidst adversity.

**Indianapolis Colts 16 - 10 Miami Dolphins**  
The Indianapolis Colts secured a narrow 16-10 victory over the Miami Dolphins with quarterback Anthony Richardson making a return after nearly three games out due to a hip injury. Despite a rocky performance, completing only 10 of 24 passes, Richardson led two crucial fourth-quarter scoring drives to clinch the win. Tyler Goodson scored his first NFL touchdown, helping to level the score early in the second half. Matt Gay’s two late field goals were decisive, and the Colts’ defense made vital stops to cement their win. The Dolphins, facing continued struggles, lost quarterback Tyler Huntley to injury, forcing Tim Boyle to finish the game. Miami had a chance to tie with a field goal, but Jason Sanders' attempt bounced off the upright. Notably, Dallas Clark was inducted into the Colts Ring of Honor during halftime, celebrating his impactful career with the team. The Colts are now trailing by one game behind the AFC South leaders, Houston Texans. Meanwhile, the Dolphins are set to host the Arizona Cardinals next Sunday.
