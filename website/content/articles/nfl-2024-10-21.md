**Buffalo Bills 34 - 10 Tennessee Titans**  
Amari Cooper instantly made an impact in his Buffalo Bills debut, catching a 12-yard touchdown pass from Josh Allen, as the Bills overcame a sluggish start to defeat the Tennessee Titans 34-10. Cooper, who joined the team just five days prior via a trade from Cleveland, adapted quickly to Buffalo's complex playbook and contributed four catches for 66 yards. His presence also helped open opportunities for other receivers, with Keon Coleman recording 125 yards on four catches. Allan celebrated his 100th career start with a 323-yard performance, tying for the sixth-most wins by a quarterback in his first 100 starts, alongside legends such as Joe Montana and Brett Favre. The Titans struggled, suffering their fifth loss of the season, with backup quarterback Mason Rudolph throwing for 215 yards, a touchdown, an interception, and a lost fumble. Buffalo's defense was pivotal in the second half, stopping Tennessee on crucial downs and allowing the Bills to break away with three touchdowns and two field goals. Injuries affected both teams, with Titans' Jaelyn Duncan and Bills' Curtis Samuel and Terrel Bernard unable to finish the game.

**Washington Commanders 40 - 7 Carolina Panthers**  
The Washington Commanders secured a commanding 40-7 victory over the Carolina Panthers, despite losing rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels to a rib injury early in the game. Marcus Mariota stepped in seamlessly, throwing two touchdown passes to tight ends Zach Ertz and Ben Sinnott, while Dante Fowler added a thrilling 67-yard pick-6 off Andy Dalton, who struggled with two interceptions. The Commanders' defense dominated, allowing just 180 yards and executing key stops. Brian Robinson Jr. made a successful return from injury, adding a rushing touchdown, as Washington accumulated 421 yards against Carolina, who continues to endure a difficult season at 1-6. Andy Dalton, starting over 2023 No.1 pick Bryce Young, finished with only 93 passing yards, further complicating the Panthers' offensive woes. The Commanders enjoyed their largest halftime lead since 2005 while injuries continued to mount for both teams, with the Panthers also losing RB Raheem Blackshear and the Commanders suffering the loss of rookie LT Brandon Coleman to a concussion.

**Green Bay Packers 24 - 22 Houston Texans**  
In a thrilling match at Lambeau Field, Brandon McManus secured a 24-22 victory for the Green Bay Packers over the Houston Texans with a dramatic 45-yard field goal as time expired. Making his debut for the Packers, McManus celebrated by performing the iconic "Lambeau Leap" into the stands. Despite three turnovers and a less-than-perfect performance, Packers quarterback Jordan Love managed to lead his team to victory, marking their third consecutive win and ending Houston's three-game streak. The Texans, hampered by injuries and missing key players, capitalized on Green Bay's mistakes to hold a halftime lead, with Joe Mixon rushing for 115 yards and two touchdowns. However, critical plays, including a touchdown catch by Josh Jacobs, who set a record for most receptions without a touchdown, and a decisive two-minute drive orchestrated by Love, helped set the stage for McManus' game-winning kick. Despite a strong rushing performance, Houston struggled with passing, as evidenced by C.J. Stroud's low passing yardage, and couldn't hold off the final Packers push.

**Los Angeles Rams 20 - 15 Las Vegas Raiders**  
In a game marked by defensive prowess, the Los Angeles Rams capitalized on the Las Vegas Raiders' struggles, forcing four turnovers in a 20-15 victory. With the Raiders' starting quarterback Aidan O'Connell sidelined by an early hand injury, backup Gardner Minshew stepped in but threw multiple interceptions, including a game-sealing pick by Rams' rookie Jaylen McCollough. Kam Curl returned a forced fumble 33 yards for a touchdown, and Kyren Williams rushed for 76 yards with two touchdowns, further solidifying the Rams' defensive strategy. Despite the victory, Matthew Stafford recorded his lowest passing yards in four seasons, as the Rams improved their defensive chemistry post-Aaron Donald's retirement. The Raiders, after losing star receiver Davante Adams to a trade, relied heavily on field goals due to red-zone inefficiencies, and were unable to recover from an early deficit. The Rams increased their unbeaten streak against the Raiders in Los Angeles to three games. The Raiders now prepare to host Kansas City, while the Rams look forward to facing Minnesota.

This performance was his second-highest rushing total of his career. Eagles’ quarterback Jalen Hurts contributed with two touchdown sneaks and a 41-yard pass to A.J. Brown, while Philadelphia's defense dominated, recording eight sacks and limiting the Giants to just 119 yards. Giants' quarterback Daniel Jones was replaced in the fourth quarter due to poor performance, expressing frustration over the decision.

The game saw several dramatic moments, including a fumble return touchdown by Ivan Pace Jr. and a missed 2-point conversion by Vikings' Sam Darnold.

**Atlanta Falcons 14 - 34 Seattle Seahawks**  
The Seattle Seahawks ended a three-game losing streak with a commanding 34-14 victory over the Atlanta Falcons, largely on the strength of their revamped defense, which forced three turnovers in the fourth quarter. Geno Smith threw two touchdown passes, including a crucial connection with DK Metcalf just before halftime. Derick Hall's standout play came with a 36-yard fumble return for a touchdown after Boye Mafe forced a fumble from Falcons quarterback Kirk Cousins. Despite Cousins' earlier successes with a TD pass to Drake London, the Seahawks' defense stifled his efforts, leading to three sacks and two interceptions. Rookie Michael Penix Jr. made his NFL debut for Atlanta but only managed a single 14-yard completion. Notably, DK Metcalf left the game with a knee injury, although Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald expressed optimism about its severity.

**San Francisco 49ers 18 - 28 Kansas City Chiefs**  
In a Super Bowl rematch, the Kansas City Chiefs continued their unbeaten streak by defeating the San Francisco 49ers 28-18, despite Patrick Mahomes not throwing a touchdown for the second consecutive game, a rarity in his career. The Chiefs excelled with a season-high 184 rushing yards and a strong defensive performance, intercepting 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy three times. Mahomes, known for his passing prowess, showcased his versatility with key rushing plays, especially a fourth-and-goal run through rookie safety Malik Mustapha. The 49ers faced a setback with wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk's potential ACL injury, compounded by All-Pro left tackle Trent Williams' ejection for hitting a Chiefs player. Meanwhile, 49ers rookie receiver Ricky Pearsall made an inspiring NFL debut 50 days after being shot, contributing three catches amidst a depleted receiving corps. The Chiefs’ victory marks their fifth consecutive win over San Francisco, reaffirming their dominance despite offensive struggles.

**Pittsburgh Steelers 37 - 15 New York Jets**  
In a commanding performance during his Pittsburgh debut, Russell Wilson led the Steelers to a decisive 37-15 victory over the New York Jets on Sunday night. Wilson, coming off a calf injury, threw for two touchdowns and ran for another, proving head coach Mike Tomlin's decision to start him over Justin Fields, despite Fields' strong performance earlier in the season, was justified. While Aaron Rodgers managed 276 passing yards and a touchdown for the Jets, his efforts were overshadowed by two critical interceptions by rookie cornerback Beanie Bishop, which the Steelers converted into pivotal scores. The Jets, now 2-5 under interim coach Jeff Ulbrich, struggled despite reinforcements with Davante Adams, whom they recently acquired to reignite synergy with Rodgers. Injuries marred both teams, with key players like Jets' Xavier Newman and the Steelers' Montravius Adams leaving the game early. The victory for the Steelers, which included contributions from Van Jefferson and a standout 111-yard performance by George Pickens, marked their second consecutive win and gave them back-to-back 30-point games for the first time since early 2020.

**Jacksonville Jaguars 32 - 16 New England Patriots**  
The Jacksonville Jaguars overcame an early 10-0 deficit to defeat the New England Patriots 32-16 at Wembley Stadium in London, showcasing resilience and sparking some optimism. Tank Bigsby played a pivotal role, rushing for 118 yards and two touchdowns, while Parker Washington dazzled with a 96-yard punt return for a score. Rookie receiver Brian Thomas Jr. contributed with a touchdown catch and a crucial 58-yard reception to set up a go-ahead score. Despite Jaguars' earlier inconsistency, this win could ease pressure on coach Doug Pederson. Meanwhile, Patriots rookie quarterback Drake Maye delivered a strong performance with 276 yards and two touchdowns but couldn't halt New England's sixth consecutive loss, prompting head coach Jerod Mayo to critique his team's softness. Notably, the game saw Jaguars adjust post-Chicago loss sentiments and featured cultural nods as Patriots cornerback Christian Gonzalez sported an England soccer shirt, echoing the presence of U.S. soccer figure Matt Turner in the crowd.

**Cleveland Browns 14 - 21 Cincinnati Bengals**  
In a dramatic turn of events, the Cleveland Browns lost to the Cincinnati Bengals 21-14, overshadowed by a serious Achilles tendon injury to quarterback Deshaun Watson. The injury, occurring in the first half without physical contact, could be season-ending and sparked polarized reactions from fans, with some cheering initially before recognizing the gravity of the situation. Browns star Myles Garrett and quarterback Jameis Winston condemned the crowd's reaction, underscoring the controversy surrounding Watson's tenure, marred by off-field issues and an uneven performance. Joe Burrow led the Bengals to victory, throwing two crucial touchdown passes in the third quarter, while Charlie Jones opened the game with a spectacular 100-yard kickoff return for a touchdown. The game also marked the return of Browns' running back Nick Chubb from a previous knee injury, scoring a touchdown and receiving a warm welcome from fans. The Bengals, having ended a six-game losing streak at Cleveland, now set their sights on Philadelphia, while the Browns prepare to face Baltimore.

**Indianapolis Colts 16 - 10 Miami Dolphins**  
In a gritty matchup, Indianapolis Colts quarterback Anthony Richardson made a triumphant return from injury to lead his team to a narrow 16-10 victory over the Miami Dolphins. Despite a shaky performance with only 129 passing yards and no touchdown throws, Richardson orchestrated crucial late drives to set up two field goals by Matt Gay, securing the win for the Colts. Meanwhile, Miami struggled with miscues and lost quarterback Tyler Huntley to injury, forcing Tim Boyle to finish the game. Huntley had thrown a TD pass to Jonnu Smith before his departure. Miami's star receivers, Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle, were largely shut down, contributing to the Dolphins' fourth loss in five games. Also noteworthy, Dallas Clark entered the Colts Ring of Honor, adding an emotional highlight to the day. Indianapolis now eyes a crucial road game against AFC South rivals Houston, while Miami prepares to host Arizona.
