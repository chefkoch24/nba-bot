**Toronto Raptors 108 - 113 New York Knicks**  
The New York Knicks secured a 113-108 victory over the Toronto Raptors, propelled by Karl-Anthony Towns' impressive return with 24 points and 15 rebounds after a one-game absence. Towns played a crucial role by breaking a tie with a late layup and sealing the win with a three-pointer. Jalen Brunson contributed 20 points and 11 assists, and Mikal Bridges added 23 points as the Knicks claimed their fifth consecutive victory over the Raptors. The game saw a setback for Toronto as Scottie Barnes exited in the third quarter with a sprained right ankle, further adding to his season's injury woes. RJ Barrett scored 30 points for Toronto, which struggled during Barnes' absence earlier in the season. Jaâ€™Kobe Walter, a rookie for the Raptors, matched his career high in the first half and ended with 19 points overall. The Knicks' win marks their fifth in six games, setting them up to host Atlanta in the NBA Cup quarterfinals, while the Raptors are set to visit Miami for their next match.
