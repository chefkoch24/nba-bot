**Orlando Magic 121 - 113 Golden State Warriors**  
In an impressive display, the Orlando Magic defeated the Golden State Warriors 121-113, led by Desmond Bane's 23 points and five steals and Anthony Black's 21 points off the bench. Despite Stephen Curry's 34 points and nine assists and Jimmy Butler's 33 points, the Warriors couldn't overcome the Magic, who boasted six players scoring at least 13 points each. Franz Wagner had 18 points and eight rebounds, while Wendell Carter Jr. contributed 17 points and 12 rebounds. Orlando maintained their shooting form with a 50.6% field goal percentage, although they struggled beyond the arc, making just 8 of 32 3-point attempts. The Warriors started strong from three-point range but faltered as the game progressed, with Curry enduring a nearly 12-minute scoreless stretch. Notably, Curry's 56-point game in Orlando last February and his recent high-scoring performances were unable to save the Warriors this time. Jonathan Kuminga and Paolo Banchero missed their third consecutive games due to injuries. Orlando has now won four of its last five games and will next face the LA Clippers at home, while the Warriors will head to Miami.

**Brooklyn Nets 99 - 113 Boston Celtics**  
In an impressive display, Jaylen Brown scored 29 points to lead the Boston Celtics to a 113-99 victory over the Brooklyn Nets, bringing their record above .500 for the first time this season. Payton Pritchard contributed a strong performance with 22 points and 10 rebounds, while Derrick White added 15 points. The Celtics, who have now won three straight games, pulled away in the fourth quarter by limiting the Nets to just one basket in the first 10 minutes of the period. Michael Porter Jr. led the Nets with 25 points, marking his seventh consecutive game scoring at least 20 points. However, after his 3-pointer put Brooklyn ahead 90-89 with just over nine minutes left, the Nets struggled to score, failing to make another basket until the closing minutes. This home defeat leaves the Nets winless in their own arena and drops their overall record to 2-12 as they prepare to face the Celtics again in Boston on Friday.

**Atlanta Hawks 112 - 120 Detroit Pistons**  
The Detroit Pistons extended their winning streak to 11 games with a 120-112 victory over the depleted Atlanta Hawks, marking their longest streak since the 2007-08 season. Cade Cunningham returned from injury to score 25 points and contribute 10 assists, becoming the first player in Pistons history to achieve 25-plus points and 10-plus assists in five consecutive games. Jalen Duren also added 24 points for Detroit, which has its best start since the 2005-06 season. Despite a valiant effort led by Jalen Johnson's 25 points and near triple-double, the Hawks struggled without several key players, including Trae Young, Kristaps Porzingis, and Zaccharie Risacher. Detroit's Duncan Robinson provided an early spark with three 3-pointers, while the Hawks nearly staged a comeback before Cunningham's crucial jumper sealed the win for the Pistons. The Hawks will face San Antonio next, while the Pistons head to Milwaukee.

**San Antonio Spurs 111 - 101 Memphis Grizzlies**  
In a tightly contested matchup marked by significant player absences, the San Antonio Spurs pulled off a 111-101 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies, led by De’Aaron Fox’s 26 points and Harrison Barnes’ pivotal 23-point performance. The Spurs were without their All-Star center Victor Wembanyama, while the Grizzlies missed star guard Ja Morant. Despite being outrebounded 59-38 and facing a 22-2 deficit in second-chance points, San Antonio overcame these challenges by outscoring Memphis 25-14 in the fourth quarter, helped by Barnes' crucial seven-point streak in the final minute. Keldon Johnson contributed 18 points for the Spurs, who continued their strong run by winning their second straight game and five of the last seven. Memphis, struggling without Morant, lost their fifth consecutive game. Both teams, dealing with injuries, will face new challengers on Thursday as the Spurs take on Atlanta and the Grizzlies meet Sacramento.

**Los Angeles Lakers 135 - 118 Utah Jazz**  
LeBron James is anticipated to make his season debut with the Los Angeles Lakers this week after recovering from sciatica, potentially rejoining the team for a home game against the Utah Jazz on Tuesday. This marks a significant milestone as James will become the first player in NBA history to play in 23 consecutive seasons. Despite his absence, the Lakers have performed admirably, with Luka Doncic and Austin Reaves averaging impressive points per game, and Deandre Ayton contributing with strong performances. Recently, the Lakers defeated the Milwaukee Bucks 119-95, showcasing their depth with a dominating display from Doncic. Meanwhile, the Jazz have been on a scoring tear, highlighted by a thrilling 150-147 double overtime victory against the Chicago Bulls, led by Lauri Markkanen's 47 points and a decisive 3-pointer by Keyonte George. The Lakers and Jazz are set to face off again soon, promising an exciting clash.

**Portland Trail Blazers 82 - 100 Phoenix Suns**  
The Phoenix Suns experienced a dramatic collapse against the Atlanta Hawks, allowing a staggering 47 points in the fourth quarter after holding a 22-point lead, resulting in a 124-122 loss at home. Despite standout performances from offseason acquisition Dillon Brooks, who scored a season-best 34 points, and Devin Booker, who added 27, Phoenix faltered. The game was marred by controversial officiating, with Brooks criticizing what he perceived as emotionally driven calls that favored Atlanta in the decisive moments. Phoenix, who had been dominating with an average margin of victory of 18.2 points during their five-game winning streak, now turns their focus to the struggling Portland Trail Blazers, who recently completed a disappointing 1-4 road trip. The Blazers, led by Shaedon Sharpe's season-high 36 points, have shown potential but are also battling inconsistency, notably surrendering over 136 points in three of their last five games. Both teams are dealing with injury complications, with key players' statuses uncertain, as they prepare for their next matchups.
