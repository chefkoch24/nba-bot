**Detroit Pistons 116 - 118 New York Knicks**  
In Game 3 of the first-round series against the Detroit Pistons, Karl-Anthony Towns and Jalen Brunson led the New York Knicks to a narrow 118-116 victory, giving them a 2-1 series advantage. Towns, who scored 31 points overall, made a strong start by contributing 11 points in the opening quarter, while Brunson, the NBA’s Clutch Player of the Year, delivered 12 of his 30 points in the crucial fourth quarter. This victory marked Towns' resurgence in three-point shooting, hitting 4-of-8 attempts after struggling in the previous games. The game ended dramatically as Detroit players and fans contested a controversial non-call on an over-and-back violation, but the Knicks maintained their composure. Despite a late surge by the Pistons, including efforts from Cade Cunningham and Tim Hardaway Jr., the Knicks held on, aided by Brunson's decisive free throws. Detroit's Jalen Duren's pass going out of bounds in the final seconds thwarted the Pistons' last-ditch attempt, extending their home playoff losing streak to eight games, nearing an NBA record. The game, characterized by emotional swings and strategic plays, sets the stage for Game 4 in Detroit.

**Memphis Grizzlies 108 - 114 Oklahoma City Thunder**  
In a thrilling Game 2 of the Western Conference first-round series, the Oklahoma City Thunder managed to secure a commanding 2-0 lead against the Memphis Grizzlies despite star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's shooting struggles. The Thunder's depth and defensive prowess were key, with standout performances from Aaron Wiggins, Jalen Williams, and Chet Holmgren, who combined for significant points and defensive plays across both games. Oklahoma City's defense was a highlight, forcing Memphis into shooting slumps and accumulating numerous turnovers, paving the way for significant wins—including a 51-point victory in the series opener. Memphis showed resilience in Game 2, particularly through forward Jaren Jackson Jr.'s improved performance, scoring 26 points after a tough Game 1, and Ja Morant's contribution in cutting down the Thunder's lead during the third quarter. Yet, Oklahoma City's unwavering defensive pressure and offensive rebounding proved too formidable for the Grizzlies to overcome.

**LA Clippers 117 - 83 Denver Nuggets**  
In a thrilling Western Conference first-round matchup, the Los Angeles Clippers seized a 2-1 series lead over the Denver Nuggets, thanks to Kawhi Leonard's exceptional performance in Game 3. Leonard, a two-time NBA Finals MVP, showcased his playoff prowess by scoring 39 points on 15-of-19 shooting, marking his 36th career playoff game with 30 or more points. Despite recent knee issues, Leonard's return to form has been a boon for the Clippers, as highlighted by coach Tyronn Lue, who emphasized the importance of having a healthy Leonard for playoff success. The Clippers, with contributions from James Harden and Ivica Zubac, capitalized on the Nuggets' 20 turnovers, including three-time MVP Nikola Jokic's seven, to secure a 105-102 victory. Jokic put up a triple-double with 26 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists, yet cited turnovers and missed free throws as pivotal in the narrow defeat. Despite splitting the series in Denver, Jokic maintained that the competitive spirit of the series has delivered some of the best basketball for fans. Under interim coach David Adelman, the Nuggets are contending with adjustments following Michael Malone's unexpected departure late in the regular season.
