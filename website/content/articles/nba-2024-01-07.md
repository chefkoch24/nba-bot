**Philadelphia 76ers 109 - 120 Utah Jazz**  
Lauri Markkanen and Collin Sexton led the Utah Jazz to a 120-109 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers, who were without injured Joel Embiid. Markkanen had 33 points and 13 rebounds, while Sexton added 22 points and 10 assists. The Jazz dominated the paint, scoring 72 points inside. The Sixers struggled without Embiid and Tobias Harris, shooting poorly from the field and missing key defensive stops. With the win, the Jazz improve to their fourth win in five games overall. Embiid's absence raises concerns about his eligibility for major NBA awards due to the league's new collective bargaining agreement.
