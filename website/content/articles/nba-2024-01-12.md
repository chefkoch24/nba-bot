**Los Angeles Lakers 109 - 127 Phoenix Suns**  
In a high-scoring game, Bradley Beal led the Phoenix Suns to a dominant 127-109 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers with a season-high 37 points, including eight 3-pointers, while Devin Booker added 31 points. Despite efforts from the Lakers, with seven players scoring in double figures, turnovers and strong play from the Suns' Big 3 of Beal, Booker, and Kevin Durant proved too much to overcome. LeBron James had 10 points on 3-of-11 shooting, and Anthony Davis and Austin Reaves scored 13 points apiece for the Lakers, who fell back below .500 at 19-20. The Suns broke a five-game losing streak against the Lakers and will now face Portland next, while the Lakers travel to Utah for their next game.
