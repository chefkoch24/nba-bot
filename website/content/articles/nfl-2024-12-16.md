**New York Giants 14 - 35 Baltimore Ravens**  
Lamar Jackson delivered an extraordinary performance by throwing five touchdown passes, tying his career high, as the Baltimore Ravens handed the New York Giants a 35-14 defeat, marking the Giants’ ninth consecutive loss, a franchise record. Jackson, who was frustrated after an early fumble, completed 21 of 25 passes for 290 yards with a remarkable quarterback rating of 154.6. His passes included long touchdowns to Rashod Bateman and contributions to Mark Andrews, who set a franchise record with his 48th career touchdown. The Ravens' victory, which moved them closer to a playoff berth, was complemented by a solid defensive effort led by Roquan Smith. Meanwhile, the Giants continued to struggle in their 100th season, suffering their eighth home loss at MetLife Stadium and dealing with quarterback injuries, including Tommy DeVito’s concussion. Embattled co-owner John Mara faced criticism from fans, highlighted by a banner flown over the stadium before the game, demanding changes in the team’s management. The Ravens, with positive momentum, are set to face Pittsburgh next, while the Giants will visit Atlanta.

**Denver Broncos 31 - 13 Indianapolis Colts**  
The Denver Broncos capitalized on five takeaways to defeat the Indianapolis Colts 31-13, moving closer to an AFC wild-card spot, potentially ending a playoff drought since 2016. The game turned on a pivotal moment when Colts' Jonathan Taylor fumbled milliseconds before scoring a touchdown, allowing the Broncos to keep the deficit manageable. A standout play came from Denver's Nik Bonitto, who intercepted a lateral pass from Anthony Richardson and returned it 50 yards for a touchdown, cementing the Broncos' comeback. Despite their struggling offense, Denver's defense provided the spark needed, with Bonitto earning praise and even a nod for Defensive Player of the Year consideration from teammate Jonathon Cooper. While Anthony Richardson scored an early rushing touchdown for the Colts, his passing performance was lackluster. Both teams showed signs of rust following their bye weeks. Denver's win also included key performances from Bo Nix and Courtland Sutton, alongside critical plays from cornerback Patrick Surtain II, who left the game injured. The Colts missed a chance to tighten the wild-card race.

**Arizona Cardinals 30 - 17 New England Patriots**  
The Arizona Cardinals broke a three-game losing streak by defeating the New England Patriots 30-17. Despite losing two linebackers to injury early in the game, the Cardinals' defense excelled, limiting the Patriots to just 311 total yards, with almost half coming in the final quarter. James Conner led the Cardinals with 110 rushing yards and two touchdowns, while right tackle Jonah Williams unexpectedly scored a touchdown by recovering a fumble in the end zone. Quarterback Kyler Murray contributed 224 passing yards and Trey McBride had nine receptions for 87 yards. The Patriots struggled offensively, going 0 for 6 on third-down conversions and committing penalties that halted their momentum. Rookie quarterback Drake Maye completed 19 of 23 passes for 202 yards, but expressed frustration over recurring mistakes. The Cardinals improved their playoff chances, while the Patriots suffered their fourth consecutive loss.

**Detroit Lions 42 - 48 Buffalo Bills**  
In a thrilling offensive showcase, Josh Allen propelled the Buffalo Bills to a 48-42 victory over the Detroit Lions, halting the Lions' 11-game winning streak. Allen's performance was remarkable, throwing for 362 yards and two touchdowns while rushing for two more, extending his league record with multiple passing and rushing TDs for the sixth time in his career. This victory keeps the Bills atop the AFC East, having also recently defeated the reigning Super Bowl champions, the Kansas City Chiefs. Despite Jared Goff matching his career high with five TD passes for the Lions, including a late-game score with Jameson Williams, the team fell short due to their inability to recover an onside kick. The Bills set a franchise record with their eighth consecutive game scoring 30 or more points, joining the 1966 New York Giants as the only teams to score 40-plus points and concede 40-plus points in two straight games. The game was marred by injuries for both teams, notably with the Lions potentially losing three players to season-ending injuries. The Bills will next host New England, while the Lions face a crucial matchup at Chicago.

**Jacksonville Jaguars 25 - 32 New York Jets**  
In a vintage performance, Davante Adams and Aaron Rodgers propelled the New York Jets to a thrilling 32-25 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars, breaking a four-game losing streak. Adams caught nine passes for 198 yards, including two touchdowns in the second half, which showcased his 100th receiving touchdown, making him the 12th player in NFL history to achieve this feat. Rodgers contributed significantly, throwing for 289 yards and three touchdowns, and leading in rushing with 45 yards. The Jets (4-10) surpassed 30 points for the first time this season, with their dynamic duo displaying the chemistry reminiscent of their days with the Green Bay Packers, despite a costly $52 million projected cap hit in 2025. The Jaguars (3-11) were led by Mac Jones, who threw 31 completions for 294 yards and two touchdowns but ended with two interceptions, one by Sauce Gardner. Rookie Brian Thomas Jr. broke two team rookie receiving records, while Jeremiah Ledbetter celebrated a sack with an acrobatic backflip. Despite early scoring, the Jaguars could not capitalize, and the Jets secured the win with a combination of strategic aggression and key plays.

**Carolina Panthers 14 - 30 Dallas Cowboys**  
In a surprising turn of events, Cooper Rush threw for a career-high three touchdown passes, leading the Dallas Cowboys to a decisive 30-14 victory over the Carolina Panthers. Despite oddsmakers favoring the Panthers for the first time in nearly two years, the Cowboys overcame their underdog status with a strong performance, forcing four turnovers from Panthers quarterback Bryce Young and sacking him six times. CeeDee Lamb played through shoulder soreness, catching nine passes for 116 yards and a touchdown, while undrafted running back Rico Dowdle rushed for 149 yards, making history as the first undrafted player since Arian Foster to surpass 100 yards in three consecutive games. The game saw standout defensive efforts from the Cowboys, particularly from Micah Parsons, who recorded two sacks, and Osa Odighizuwa, who forced a fumble that led to a Cowboys touchdown. The Cowboys' defense held the Panthers to just one yard in the third quarter and effectively shut down Carolina's leading rusher, Chuba Hubbard. Despite a brief comeback attempt led by Young's 83-yard touchdown pass to rookie Jalen Coker, the Panthers fell short, leaving Young with a 4-21 record as an NFL starter. The Cowboys will host the Tampa Bay Buccaneers next, while the Panthers face the Arizona Cardinals.

**New Orleans Saints 19 - 20 Washington Commanders**  
The Washington Commanders narrowly defeated the New Orleans Saints 20-19, thanks to rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels' two touchdown passes to Terry McLaurin and the Saints' failed 2-point conversion attempt. Despite Washington establishing a 17-0 lead, New Orleans' rookie QB Spencer Rattler nearly orchestrated a comeback after replacing Jake Haener. Rattler led a last-minute touchdown drive, but their 2-point conversion fell short, leaving the Saints without a win in Derek Carr's absence. Daniels showcased his talent by completing 25 of 31 passes with 226 yards and rushing for 66 yards, including a critical third-quarter scramble. Meanwhile, officiating controversies marred the game, including a curious late-game clock stoppage, and the Commanders dealt with penalty issues. Saints' coach Darren Rizzi and his team expressed no regrets about their decisive play, emphasizing their collective support for the aggressive call.

**Los Angeles Chargers 17 - 40 Tampa Bay Buccaneers**  
In a decisive victory, Baker Mayfield led the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to a 40-17 win over the Los Angeles Chargers, marking a standout performance in his 100th career start. Mayfield threw for four touchdowns and amassed 288 passing yards, steering the Buccaneers from a 17-10 deficit to scoring on six consecutive drives. A highlight came as Mike Evans caught a 57-yard touchdown pass to give Tampa Bay the lead early in the third quarter. Evans finished with a season-high 159 receiving yards and two touchdowns, becoming the player with the second-most 150-yard receiving games among active players. Rookie Bucky Irving contributed significantly with 117 rushing yards, as Tampa Bay's offense outperformed the Chargers, gaining over 500 total yards. Justin Herbert's interception ended his impressive 357-attempt streak without a pick, contributing to the Chargers' struggles. Despite the loss, Los Angeles holds a playoff position but faces challenges with key injuries. The Buccaneers will visit Dallas next, while the Chargers prepare to host Denver.

**Philadelphia Eagles 27 - 13 Pittsburgh Steelers**  
Jalen Hurts led the Philadelphia Eagles to a 27-13 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers, marking the team's franchise-record 10th consecutive win. Despite recent internal friction over the Eagles' passing game, particularly with wide receivers A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith voicing their dissatisfaction, Hurts silenced critics by connecting with both on touchdown passes. Playing through a broken finger on his non-throwing hand, he threw for 290 yards. Brown and Smith combined for impressive stats, each eclipsing 100 receiving yards. Saquon Barkley's quest for the NFL rushing record faced a setback as he managed only 65 yards. The Steelers, already playoff-bound, suffered a blow with linebacker T.J. Watt's ankle injury. The Eagles capitalized on key errors, including a botched pitch by Steelers quarterback Russell Wilson. This matchup, the first when both teams had double-digit wins, proved not as competitive as anticipated, with Hurts' performance underscoring his resilience amidst scrutiny.

**Seattle Seahawks 13 - 30 Green Bay Packers**  
In a decisive 30-13 victory over the Seattle Seahawks, Jordan Love threw two touchdown passes to Romeo Doubs, helping the Green Bay Packers end Seattle's four-game winning streak. This win was marked by Seattle's quarterback Geno Smith suffering a knee injury after being hit by Packers linebacker Edgerrin Cooper, leading to Smith's exit and replacement by Sam Howell. Love completed 20 of 27 passes for 229 yards, while running back Josh Jacobs contributed significantly with 94 rushing yards and a touchdown. The Packers took an early lead, scoring on all first-half possessions and leading 20-3 at halftime. Despite a brief Seahawks resurgence with Zach Charbonnet's 24-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter, Doubs' spectacular 22-yard touchdown grab sealed the Packers' victory in Lumen Field, their first win in Seattle since 2008. The Seahawks now share the NFC West's top spot with the Los Angeles Rams, with Smith's injury potentially affecting their division championship hopes.

**Tennessee Titans 27 - 37 Cincinnati Bengals**  
In an eventful game, the Cincinnati Bengals, led by Joe Burrow's record-setting performance, defeated the Tennessee Titans 37-27. Burrow threw for 271 yards and three touchdowns, breaking his own franchise record with a 36th TD pass for the season. Though the Bengals improved to 6-8, their playoff chances remain slim. The game featured a rare 10 turnovers, marking the first such instance since 2007. Despite significant turnovers and penalties on both sides, the Bengals capitalized on six turnovers, scoring 24 points, including a pivotal pick-six by Geno Stone. Sam Hubbard became the first Bengals defensive player to score on a pass since 1968 before leaving with a knee injury. The Titans, struggling at 3-11, replaced quarterback Will Levis after his fourth pick-six this season, as Tennessee incurred their third consecutive loss. Notably, Ja'Marr Chase joined elite company with season stats matching all-time greats like Jerry Rice and Randy Moss.

**Cleveland Browns 7 - 21 Kansas City Chiefs**  
In a notable game, the Kansas City Chiefs secured a 21-7 victory over the Cleveland Browns, marking one of their few easy wins this season. Patrick Mahomes threw two touchdown passes before exiting in the fourth quarter due to an ankle injury, though post-game X-rays were negative, much to the relief of coach Andy Reid. Despite Mahomes' early departure, the Chiefs built an early lead with touchdowns to JuJu Smith-Schuster and Noah Gray and a rushing TD from Xavier Worthy, capitalizing on the Browns' six turnovers. Cleveland struggled offensively, with Jameis Winston throwing three interceptions and being replaced by Dorian Thompson-Robinson. Myles Garrett had a scare with an apparent eye injury but returned to finish the game, while other notable injuries included Nick Chubb suffering a broken foot. Taylor Swift, rumored to attend in support of Travis Kelce, was notably absent. The Chiefs next face Houston, while the Browns head to Cincinnati.

**Houston Texans 20 - 12 Miami Dolphins**  
The Houston Texans secured their second consecutive AFC South title with a 20-12 victory over the Miami Dolphins, fueled by a stellar performance from cornerback Derek Stingley, who shadowed Tyreek Hill effectively and recorded two crucial fourth-quarter interceptions. Nico Collins contributed offensively with two touchdown receptions, while C.J. Stroud threw for 131 yards and two touchdowns despite minimal support from the ground game. Tua Tagovailoa struggled, throwing three interceptions and losing a fumble without his starting tackles, leading to Miami's missed opportunity to capitalize and tie the game. A concerning moment arose when Dolphins receiver Grant DuBose suffered a head injury, leading to his departure on a stretcher, though he was later reported stable. Additionally, Miami's Jaylen Waddle exited with a knee injury, and Houston missed tight end Cade Stover due to an emergency appendectomy. The Texans will next face the Kansas City Chiefs, while the Dolphins host the San Francisco 49ers.
