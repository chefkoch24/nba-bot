**Washington Wizards 96 - 108 Boston Celtics**  
In a competitive NBA Cup match, the Boston Celtics secured a 108-96 victory over the Washington Wizards, despite an off night from Jayson Tatum, who missed all ten of his three-point attempts but managed to score 16 points, extending his streak to 55 games with at least 15 points.

**Denver Nuggets 120 - 123 Dallas Mavericks**  
In a tight NBA Cup group stage clash, the Dallas Mavericks will face the Denver Nuggets, who might see the return of their superstar, Nikola Jokic, after missing games due to personal reasons. However, the Mavericks are confirmed to be without Luka Doncic, sidelined by a right wrist injury, presenting a significant challenge as both teams vie for survival in the competition. Dallas, currently reliant on Kyrie Irving—who recently scored 43 points against Denver—aims to secure a fourth straight win despite lacking depth previously evident when they narrowly lost to the Nuggets. Meanwhile, Denver triumphed recently over Memphis with Russell Westbrook's historic 200th triple-double, although the victory was dampened by losing Vlatko Cancar to injury, adding to their roster challenges alongside the uncertain status of Jokic. Coach Michael Malone may look further down his bench for depth, with players like Trey Alexander and Dario Saric stepping up amid the ongoing player absences.
