**Philadelphia 76ers 102 - 94 Orlando Magic**  
In a closely contested matchup, the Philadelphia 76ers emerged victorious over the Orlando Magic with a 102-94 win. Paul George, in only his second game back after bruising his knee, played a pivotal role with 21 points and nine assists, while KJ Martin contributed 20 points, helping Philadelphia secure their third win in four games, improving their record to 6-15. Despite a strong showing from Franz Wagner, who scored 30 points for the Magic, and Jalen Suggs with 22, Orlando fell to 16-9 and struggled with their shooting, particularly from beyond the arc, going 0 for 13 in the second quarter. The Magic, who entered the game with the NBA's lowest three-point shooting percentage at 31.2%, saw a decent lead turn into a nine-point deficit following a poor shooting performance. The 76ers, on the other hand, managed to stave off a late Magic rally by forcing key turnovers and capitalizing on the offensive end. This game highlighted ongoing concerns for the Magic's offensive consistency and a potential return of Joel Embiid for the 76ers as he recovers from chronic knee swelling. Philadelphia will face Chicago next, while Orlando hosts Phoenix on Sunday.

**Atlanta Hawks 134 - 132 Los Angeles Lakers**  
In a thrilling overtime game, Trae Young's clutch 3-pointer with 7.4 seconds left lifted the Atlanta Hawks to a 134-132 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers, marking Atlanta's sixth consecutive win. Young led the Hawks with 31 points, overcoming impressive performances by the Lakers' stars, LeBron James and Anthony Davis, who scored 39 and 38 points respectively. Despite their efforts, the Lakers suffered their third straight defeat and seventh in nine games. James had a chance to win the game in regulation, but his long 3-pointer missed, and a collision with Davis left him briefly in pain. Dyson Daniels made crucial defensive plays for the Hawks in overtime, leading to Young's decisive basket. Atlanta's bench also played a significant role, outscoring the Lakers' reserves 65-17. This win extends the Hawks' longest winning streak since January 2022. The Lakers will aim to bounce back against the Portland Trail Blazers on Sunday, while the Hawks face the Denver Nuggets.

In a thrilling game, the Boston Celtics edged out the Milwaukee Bucks 111-105, highlighted by Jayson Tatum's standout performance of 34 points and 10 rebounds. This victory marked Boston's 10th win in their last 11 games. Jaylen Brown contributed 25 points, while the team collectively sank 17 three-pointers. Despite an impressive 31 points from Damian Lillard and a 30-point, 11-rebound showing from Giannis Antetokounmpo, the Bucks fell short in their second consecutive loss after a seven-game winning streak. The game was notable for being Khris Middleton's season debut for Milwaukee, where he tallied 11 points and five assists in his return from ankle surgeries. The match featured intense back-and-forth play, encapsulated by on-court antics between Antetokounmpo and Brown—reminiscent of their encounter in a previous game—resulting in a technical foul on Brown. The Celtics' consistent success against the Bucks this season underscores their solid play, while the Bucks aim to reintegrate Middleton to bolster their Eastern Conference prospects.

A notable performance came from San Antonio's Julian Champagnie, achieving career-highs with 30 points and six 3-pointers.

The Kings turned the game around in the second quarter with a 50-27 run, transforming a 13-point deficit into a halftime lead.
