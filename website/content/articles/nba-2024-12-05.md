**Boston Celtics 130 - 120 Detroit Pistons**  
The Boston Celtics secured a 130-120 victory over the Detroit Pistons, marking their ninth win in the last ten games, thanks to impressive performances by Jaylen Brown and Kristaps Porzingis, who scored 28 and 26 points, respectively. The Celtics dominated early, establishing a 12-point run to kick off the game and maintaining a significant lead until the fourth quarter when the Pistons narrowed the gap with a barrage of 3-pointers, forcing coach Joe Mazzulla to reinsert Brown. Despite a late push by Detroit, highlighted by Tobias Harris' clutch 3-pointer, Boston's Payton Pritchard sealed the win with his own 3-pointer. Notably, Cade Cunningham excelled for the Pistons with a near triple-double, while the team set a season-high with 20 successful 3-pointers. Remarkably, Boston triumphed without Jayson Tatum and Jrue Holiday, with Porzingis entertaining fans by engaging with them after scoring free throws. Sam Hauser, making his second start of the year, added 20 points. The Celtics are set to face Milwaukee next, while the Pistons head to New York.

Cam Johnson led the Brooklyn Nets to a 99-90 victory over the Indiana Pacers, snapping a three-game losing streak with his impressive 26-point performance. Nic Claxton contributed 16 points, while Shake Milton added 15 points off the bench for the Nets.

Despite a rocky start with poor shooting and 12 turnovers in the first half, the Pacers improved their ball-handling after halftime. Indiana's T.J. McConnell and Tyrese Haliburton scored 14 and 13 points, respectively, but the team has now lost four straight games and seven of their last ten. The Nets, with Johnson scoring at least 20 points in nine games this season, closed the game strong by outscoring the Pacers 19-10 in the final eight minutes. Brooklyn will face Milwaukee next, while Indiana travels to Chicago.

In a tightly contested game, the Orlando Magic overcame the Philadelphia 76ers with a 106-102 victory, led by Franz Wagner's impressive 35-point performance and Jalen Suggs adding 17 points. Despite being short-handed as key players like Joel Embiid, Paul George, Andre Drummond, and Kyle Lowry were sidelined, the 76ers, now 5-15, could not capitalize on an anticipated strong start to the season. Rising star Jared McCain was a highlight for Philadelphia, scoring 24 points, while Tyrese Maxey struggled from beyond the arc, going 0-for-7 on 3-point attempts. The Magic, rebounding from a loss the previous night, showcased their depth with significant contributions from their bench and pulled ahead in the fourth quarter on a crucial 10-2 run. Both teams are set to face off again in Philadelphia on Friday.

**LA Clippers 80 - 108 Minnesota Timberwolves**  
The Minnesota Timberwolves are set to face the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday, following a recent trend of improved performances. This turnaround was sparked by Anthony Edwards’ critique of the team’s selfish play, leading to victories against the Clippers and Lakers, with Julius Randle, Rudy Gobert, and Nickeil Alexander-Walker stepping up, especially during Edwards’ off night against the Lakers. Coach Chris Finch praised the team’s mental resilience after their locker room talk. Meanwhile, the Clippers, coming off a 127-105 win over the Trail Blazers, are relying on Norman Powell, who scored 30 points in his second game back from injury, and James Harden. With major players like Paul George and Kawhi Leonard unavailable, Powell has taken on a more prominent scoring role. Clippers coach Tyronn Lue highlighted their offensive adaptability as they aim to continue their nine-game home winning streak, despite recent injuries to players like Kevin Porter Jr. and Terance Mann.
