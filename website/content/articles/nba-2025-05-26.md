**Indiana Pacers 100 - 106 New York Knicks**  
The New York Knicks rallied from a 20-point deficit to defeat the Indiana Pacers 106-100 in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference finals, narrowing Indiana's series lead to 2-1. With Jalen Brunson plagued by foul trouble, Karl-Anthony Towns led the Knicks' comeback with a standout fourth-quarter performance, scoring 20 of his 24 points and grabbing 15 rebounds. Brunson contributed despite limited minutes, finishing with 23 points. The close contest saw New York claiming the lead with just over seven minutes remaining and maintaining it to secure the win, making it three consecutive wins for road teams in the series. The Pacers, led by Tyrese Haliburton's 20 points and Myles Turner's 19, struggled without top defender Aaron Nesmith, who sprained his ankle, and dropped to 0-4 historically when playing on the same day as the Indianapolis 500. The game, marked by Indiana's strong start and notable spectators such as Reggie Miller, ended with coach Rick Carlisle acknowledging his team's failure to execute down the stretch. Game 4 will be played on Tuesday night in Indianapolis.
