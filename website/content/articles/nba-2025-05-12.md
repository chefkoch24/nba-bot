**Denver Nuggets 87 - 92 Oklahoma City Thunder**  
The Oklahoma City Thunder, the NBA's youngest team, tied their second-round series against the Denver Nuggets with a 92-87 victory in Game 4, showcasing remarkable composure in the crucial moments. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander shone with nine of his 25 points in the fourth quarter, pulling the Thunder back from what could have been a daunting 3-1 deficit against a Denver team that has a strong reputation for closing out playoff series. After an exhausting overtime Game 3, both teams seemed sluggish in the early Mother's Day tip-off, leading to a low-scoring first half. However, Oklahoma City's bench, particularly Cason Wallace, who contributed key 3-pointers, helped turn the game around with a crucial 11-0 run. Despite Nikola Jokic's 27 points and 13 rebounds, Denver struggled with a poor shooting performance and several late-game mistakes, including a five-second inbounds violation. The victory was a testament to the Thunder's growing resilience and depth, as emphasized by their coach, Mark Daigneault.
