**New York Knicks 93 - 115 Boston Celtics**  
The Boston Celtics rebounded in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference semifinals with a dominant 115-93 victory over the New York Knicks, led by Jayson Tatum's 22 points, nine rebounds, and seven assists, and Payton Pritchard's 23-point performance. After struggling with their shooting in the first two games, the Celtics found their 3-point rhythm, hitting 50% from beyond the arc. The defending NBA champions established a commanding lead early, never trailing, and handed the Knicks a resounding loss. Despite Jalen Brunson's 27 points and Karl-Anthony Towns' double-double for New York, the Knicks failed to mount a comeback. The Celtics will seek to equalize the series in Game 4 on Monday, capitalizing on their newfound shooting prowess. New York, still in search of their first conference finals berth since 2000, must regain focus after squandering a 2-0 series lead.

**Golden State Warriors 97 - 102 Minnesota Timberwolves**  
In a closely contested battle, Anthony Edwards led the Minnesota Timberwolves to a 102-97 victory over the Golden State Warriors, securing a 2-1 lead in their second-round playoff series. Edwards was instrumental, scoring 36 points and hitting a crucial baseline three-pointer with 1:19 left on the clock. Julius Randle contributed a triple-double with 24 points, 12 assists, and 10 rebounds, overcoming a slow start after missing his first four three-point attempts. Despite strong performances from Jimmy Butler, who scored 33 points, and Jonathan Kuminga's 30-point effort off the bench, the Warriors missed Stephen Curry's presence, as he was sidelined with a hamstring strain. Buddy Hield briefly pulled the Warriors close with late baskets, but the team faltered due to defensive lapses and missed three-point shots. Draymond Green fouled out late in the game amidst controversy over a questionable call, further hindering the Warriors' efforts.
