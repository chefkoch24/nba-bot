**New York Rangers 1 - 4 Anaheim Ducks**  
In a commanding 5-1 victory over the Anaheim Ducks, Chris Kreider's two-goal night propelled the New York Rangers at Madison Square Garden. Kreider not only matched and surpassed Adam Graves to move into third place on the Rangers' all-time goals list with his 281st career goal, but he also celebrated his 500th NHL point. Despite the Rangers' recent struggles, losing three of their past four games, Kreider's performance and a steadfast effort from goaltender Jonathan Quick—who made 28 saves—ensured the win. Quick remains undefeated this season with a 9-0-1 record. Mika Zibanejad contributed with a goal and an assist, while Adam Edstrom made a memorable NHL debut by scoring in the final second. The Ducks, who struggled with penalties, offered six power-play opportunities to the Rangers, conceding two goals in such situations, and scoring only once through Brett Leason. With this triumph, the Rangers became the second team to reach 20 wins this season.
