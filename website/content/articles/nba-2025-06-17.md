**Oklahoma City Thunder 120 - 109 Indiana Pacers**  
In a pivotal Game 5 of the NBA Finals, the Oklahoma City Thunder secured a 3-2 lead over the Indiana Pacers with a 120-109 victory, positioning themselves just one win away from their first NBA title. Jalen Williams led the charge with a career playoff-high 40 points, while MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander contributed 31 points and 10 assists. Despite the Thunder's commanding 18-point lead, the resilient Pacers, known for their playoff comebacks, clawed back to within two points in the fourth quarter, largely driven by TJ McConnell's energetic play. However, the Thunder's strong finish, coupled with strategic improvements after Game 4, allowed them to pull away for good. Pascal Siakam and an injured Tyrese Haliburton led Indiana's efforts, but it wasn't enough to overcome the well-synchronized Oklahoma City team. Historically, teams that have taken a 3-2 lead in a tied NBA Finals have won the championship 82% of the time. With this victory, the Thunder are on the brink of glory, ready to cement their greatness with one final win.
