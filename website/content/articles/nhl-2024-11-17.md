**Boston Bruins 2 - 3 St Louis Blues**  
Brayden Schenn’s overtime goal led the St. Louis Blues to a spirited 3-2 victory over the Boston Bruins at TD Garden, snapping their four-game losing streak. Schenn capitalized on a solo opportunity, firing a wrist shot from the left face-off circle to clinch the win. Notably, Schenn’s overtime goal was his ninth with the Blues, putting him just one behind franchise leader Vladimir Tarasenko. Radek Faksa contributed with a goal and an assist, while Alexey Toropchenko added two assists for the Blues. Despite Trent Frederic's two-goal effort for the Bruins, Boston continued their slump, having lost three of their last four games, with Joonas Korpisalo making 28 saves. Frederic’s performance marked him as the third Missouri-born player to score multiple goals against the Blues. Boston also experienced setbacks, with Mark Kastelic leaving early due to injury and Tyler Johnson absent for family reasons, although Georgii Merkulov celebrated his first NHL point in his season debut.

**Seattle Kraken 3 - 2 New York Islanders**  
The Seattle Kraken triumphed in an eight-round shootout against the New York Islanders, sealing a 4-3 victory and handing the Islanders their seventh consecutive loss. Kailer Yamamoto was pivotal for the Kraken, scoring both the game-tying goal in the third period and the decisive goal in the shootout. Seattle's power play was highly effective, matching a franchise record by netting three goals, with Yamamoto, Matty Beniers, and Alex Wennberg all contributing. The Islanders struggled with special teams, allowing three power-play goals despite scoring three of their own. Philipp Grubauer's 20 saves helped secure the win for Seattle, breaking their six-game shootout losing streak that dated back to April 2022. Although New York captain Anders Lee opened the scoring, Barzal's two assists weren't enough to prevent the Islanders' mounting losses, with an ongoing issue being their difficulty in the third period.

**Toronto Maple Leafs 4 - 3 Edmonton Oilers**  
In an exciting overtime victory at Scotiabank Arena, the Toronto Maple Leafs surmounted the Edmonton Oilers 4-3, with Mitch Marner scoring the decisive goal just 40 seconds into overtime. Marner's pivotal role was underscored by his defensive efforts leading up to his game-winning goal, marking his 200th career goal and bringing his points total this season to 24. Teammate Bobby McMann also shone brightly with two goals, while Anthony Stolarz made 27 saves to help the Leafs clinch their second consecutive win. For the Oilers, Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl put up strong performances with a goal and an assist each. An injury notably impacted the Oilers' lineup as Darnell Nurse exited the game due to a head hit, resulting in Ryan Reaves receiving a five-minute penalty. Despite their efforts and a late tying goal from Draisaitl, the Oilers' three-game winning streak was snapped, and they had to settle for a single point.

Mike Matheson played a pivotal role with a goal and an assist, while Nick Suzuki, Josh Anderson, and Lucas Condotta also found the back of the net for Montreal, with Joel Armia and Cole Caufield contributing two assists each. Sam Montembeault's 25 saves aided the win, marking Montreal's second victory in three games following a six-game slump. Despite Dante Fabbro scoring his first goal since joining Columbus, the team could not maintain their game plan, leading to their seventh loss in eight games. Highlights included Matheson’s first goal of the season from a Caufield pass and Jake Evans reaching his 100th NHL point. Montreal's win ensured their sixth consecutive triumph over the Blue Jackets.

**Tampa Bay Lightning 4 - 0 New Jersey Devils**  
Vasilevskiy makes 29 saves, Lightning shut out Devils
 **TAMPA --** <forge-entity title="Andrei Vasilevskiy" slug="andrei-vasilevskiy-8476883" code="player">Andrei Vasilevskiy</forge-entity> made 29 saves for the Tampa Bay Lightning in a 4-0 win against the New Jersey Devils at Amalie Arena on Saturday. 
The shutout was Vasilevskiy’s second of the season and 36th in the NHL.

Vasilevskiy was honored for earning his 300th win on Thursday during a pre-game ceremony that featured congratulations from Hall of Fame goalie Martin Brodeur and former Lightning goalies <forge-entity title="Nikolai Khabibulin" slug="nikolai-khabibulin-8459140" code="player">Nikolai Khabibulin</forge-entity> and <forge-entity title="Ben Bishop" slug="ben-bishop-8471750" code="player">Ben Bishop</forge-entity>.

"It's a huge honor," Vasilevskiy said. "Honored to have such a great ceremony. I thought the guys played well. Obviously, the team gave me a couple of gifts before the game, the most important gift was that they played great in front of me...too many gifts tonight." 
<forge-entity title="Victor Hedman" slug="victor-hedman-8475167" code="player">Victor Hedman</forge-entity> and <forge-entity title="Anthony Cirelli" slug="anthony-cirelli-8478519" code="player">Anthony Cirelli</forge-entity> each had a goal and an assist, and <forge-entity title="Nick Paul" slug="nicholas-paul-8477426" code="player">Nick Paul</forge-entity> also scored for the Lightning (9-6-1), who have won two in a row following a four-game skid. <forge-entity title="Nikita Kucherov" slug="nikita-kucherov-8476453" code="player">Nikita Kucherov</forge-entity> had two assists to extend his point streak to seven games (three goals, nine assists).

"We're defending the way you should defend...with numbers," Tampa Bay coach Jon Cooper said. "When you're able to defend as a group of five, not putting stress on yourself, we've done a really good job of protecting the net. But it all stems from just not giving up the freebies...when you're not giving up the odd-man rushes and, like I said, defending as a group with a plan, these are the kind of things that happen."

<forge-entity title="Jacob Markstrom" slug="jacob-markstrom-8474593" code="player">Jacob Markstrom</forge-entity> made 23 saves for the Devils (12-7-2), who had won five of six (5-1-0).

"I thought we played a good game, I thought we played a smart game," New Jersey coach Sheldon Keefe said. "We were right there. I just think they were a little bit better in a lot of small details of the game and when you add them up it's enough for them to get one, then two, then three, and just kind of pull away from us. I wouldn't change a lot about our game, just little things here and there that they were better than us." 
Paul gave Tampa Bay a 1-0 lead at 14:27 of the first period when he scored on a shot above the right circle with <forge-entity title="Gage Goncalves" slug="gage-goncalves-8482201" code="player">Gage Goncalves</forge-entity> providing a screen in front of the net.

<forge-entity title="Darren Raddysh" slug="darren-raddysh-8478178" code="player">Darren Raddysh</forge-entity> scored his first goal of the season 39 seconds into the third period to make it 2-0, a one-timer from the right circle off a pass from Kucherov after Cirelli won a draw in the zone.

"Both teams limited each other's chances, we both played well defensively," Devils forward <forge-entity title="Jesper Bratt" slug="jesper-bratt-8479407" code="player">Jesper Bratt</forge-entity> said. "I think it was the small details...they found a way to score and got in front of \[Markstrom's\] eyes. That's how they scored their goals and that's how we didn't score."

Hedman’s power-play goal extended it to 3-0 at 7:40, a slap shot from the point.

"\[The power play\] has been a work in progress," Hedman said. "Trying to find what works. Just throw different things at the opponent, but we have so many good players, it's about making those right reads, and we did that today." 
Cirelli was awarded an empty-net goal at 19:48 for the 4-0 final when New Jersey defenseman <forge-entity title="Luke Hughes" slug="luke-hughes-8482684" code="player">Luke Hughes</forge-entity> threw his stick out in front of him on a breakaway.

"I think they played a solid game defensively, like ourselves too," Markstrom said. "I think it was a really tight game, it would have been nice to make another save or two to make it a tighter game in the third."

**NOTES:** Vasilevskiy’s 36 shutouts since his debut season in 2014-15 are tied for the third most among all goaltenders behind <forge-entity title="Marc-Andre Fleury" slug="marc-andre-fleury-8470594" code="player">Marc-Andre Fleury</forge-entity> (47) and <forge-entity title="Connor Hellebuyck" slug="connor-hellebuyck-8476945" code="player">Connor Hellebuyck</forge-entity> (40). … Kucherov is one point shy of 900 in the NHL (331 goals, 568 assists in 741 games). <forge-entity title="Steven Stamkos" slug="steven-stamkos-8474564" code="player">Steven Stamkos</forge-entity> (555-582 -- 1137) and <forge-entity title="Martin St. Louis" slug="martin-st-louis-8466378" code="player">Martin St. Louis</forge-entity> (365-588 -- 953) are the only players in Lightning history to reach the mark.

**Florida Panthers 5 - 0 Winnipeg Jets**  
Panthers score 5, Bobrovsky makes 27 saves in shutout win against Jets
 **SUNRISE, Fla. --** <forge-entity title="Sergei Bobrovsky" slug="sergei-bobrovsky-8475683" code="player">Sergei Bobrovsky</forge-entity> made 27 saves, and <forge-entity title="Aleksander Barkov" slug="aleksander-barkov-8477493" code="player">Aleksander Barkov</forge-entity> and <forge-entity title="Sam Reinhart" slug="sam-reinhart-8477933" code="player">Sam Reinhart</forge-entity> each had three points for the Florida Panthers in a 5-0 win against the Winnipeg Jets at Amerant Bank Arena on Saturday. 
“I thought the guys did a great job,” said Bobrovsky, who earned his 45th NHL shutout and 12th with the Panthers. “It was a complete game. All four lines were rolling. It was fun to be a part of.”

Barkov had a goal and two assists, Reinhart had three assists, and <forge-entity title="Gustav Forsling" slug="gustav-forsling-8478055" code="player">Gustav Forsling</forge-entity> had two assists for the Panthers (12-5-1), who had lost consecutive games to the New Jersey Devils on Tuesday and Thursday.

Florida coach Paul Maurice, who coached the Jets for parts of nine seasons before resigning in 2021, got his first win against Winnipeg after going 0-3-1 the past two seasons.

“We finally did not play terrible,’’ Maurice said. “In the four games we played against these guys, we have not been very good. This was not about Winnipeg for us; it was about our past two games and righting the ship.” 
<forge-entity title="Connor Hellebuyck" slug="connor-hellebuyck-8476945" code="player">Connor Hellebuyck</forge-entity> made 26 saves for the Jets (15-3-0), who have lost consecutive games after the best start to a season in NHL history (15 wins in 16 games).

“What we did was make mistakes against the Stanley Cup champions,’’ Winnipeg coach Scott Arniel said. “They're a team that's lost two games at home here in their building against New Jersey. We knew they weren't going to be giving us any freebies. We made mistakes and they put them in the back of the net.’’

<forge-entity title="Mackie Samoskevich" slug="mackie-samoskevich-8482713" code="player">Mackie Samoskevich</forge-entity> gave the Panthers a 1-0 lead at 14:59 of the first period, redirecting Forsling’s shot through traffic in front of the net.

Florida scored three goals in the second period to take a commanding 4-0 lead into the third.

<forge-entity title="Nate Schmidt" slug="nate-schmidt-8477220" code="player">Nate Schmidt</forge-entity>, who spent the past three seasons with the Jets, made it 2-0 at 2:07 when he put in a rebound off <forge-entity title="Sam Bennett" slug="sam-bennett-8477935" code="player">Sam Bennett</forge-entity>’s shot.

“I disconnected for a second,’’ Schmidt said of the goal. “I was watching Bennett as a fan. I stopped skating for a second, thought ‘Wow! Nice play! Oh, I should probably be on there.’ But it felt good, especially at that time of the game. It was still a tight game at that point. To get something like that feels good, and it really feels good after our past couple of games.’’

<forge-entity title="Evan Rodrigues" slug="evan-rodrigues-8478542" code="player">Evan Rodrigues</forge-entity> pushed it to 3-0 at 12:21, finishing off a rebound in front of the net.

Barkov tucked in a backhand at the top of the crease off a short-handed 2-on-1 rush to make it 4-0 at 14:36.

“Winnipeg got off to a great start, and there is a reason they are the first team in the League right now,’’ Barkov said. “They showed us that in the first period. But we stuck with it. \[Bobrovsky\] made some unbelievable saves, kept us in the game. Then, we took over in the second.’’ 
<forge-entity title="Dmitry Kulikov" slug="dmitry-kulikov-8475179" code="player">Dmitry Kulikov</forge-entity> tapped in a centering pass from Barkov for the 5-0 final at 3:23 of the third period.

The series between these two teams now heads to Winnipeg, where the Jets will play host to the Panthers on Tuesday (8 p.m. ET; TSN3, SCRIPPS).

“I think we got away from certain aspects that make us good,’’ Winnipeg defenseman <forge-entity title="Dylan DeMelo" slug="dylan-demelo-8476331" code="player">Dylan DeMelo</forge-entity> said. “I think you've got to give them a lot of credit, too. I thought they played a really strong game. Nothing that we were surprised about but I think things that we'll definitely be aware for next time, a good blueprint for us to see what we can expect on Tuesday. We need to bring it. Now it's our turn, in our building, so I think we're excited to get home and play them again."

**NOTES:** Reinhart extended his point streak to 10 games (eight goals, eight assists) for the second time in his career with the Panthers. He had a 13-game point streak last season. … Barkov extended his assist streak to eight games (13 assists) and tied the second-longest such stretch in franchise history (<forge-entity title="Jonathan Huberdeau" slug="jonathan-huberdeau-8476456" code="player">Jonathan Huberdeau</forge-entity> in 2021-22 and <forge-entity title="Olli Jokinen" slug="olli-jokinen-8466140" code="player">Olli Jokinen</forge-entity> in 2005-06). Huberdeau’s 10-game assist streak is the franchise record. … Barkov’s 13 short-handed goals are second in franchise history behind <forge-entity title="Radek Dvorak" slug="radek-dvorak-8462041" code="player">Radek Dvorak</forge-entity> (16).

**Carolina Hurricanes 4 - 0 Ottawa Senators**  
Martin gets 1st NHL shutout for Hurricanes in win against Senators 
 **RALEIGH, N.C. --** <forge-entity title="Spencer Martin" slug="spencer-martin-8477484" code="player">Spencer Martin</forge-entity> made 24 saves for his first NHL shutout, and the Carolina Hurricanes defeated the Ottawa Senators 4-0 at Lenovo Center on Saturday. 
“It’s pretty cool,” Martin said. “I’m more focused on winning games; I don’t go in there looking for a shutout, but it’s fun.”  
  
Martin is starting with <forge-entity title="Frederik Andersen" slug="frederik-andersen-8475883" code="player">Frederik Andersen</forge-entity> and <forge-entity title="Pyotr Kochetkov" slug="pyotr-kochetkov-8481611" code="player">Pyotr Kochetkov</forge-entity> out with injuries.

“I don’t look at it as a tough situation,” said the 29-year-old goalie who is in his second season with the Hurricanes. “Tougher would be me not being where I want to be. I really feel like it’s meant to be that I got the chance. I’m enjoying it, and I’m going to try to do my best with it.” 
<forge-entity title="Jordan Martinook" slug="jordan-martinook-8476921" code="player">Jordan Martinook</forge-entity> had a goal and an assist, and <forge-entity title="Martin Necas" slug="martin-necas-8480039" code="player">Martin Necas</forge-entity> extended his point streak to 12 games (eight goals, 15 assists) for the Hurricanes (12-4-0), who have won two of their past three games. <forge-entity title="Jordan Staal" slug="jordan-staal-8473533" code="player">Jordan Staal</forge-entity> and <forge-entity title="Shayne Gostisbehere" slug="shayne-gostisbehere-8476906" code="player">Shayne Gostisbehere</forge-entity> each had two assists.

<forge-entity title="Anton Forsberg" slug="anton-forsberg-8476341" code="player">Anton Forsberg</forge-entity> made 24 saves for the Senators (8-8-1), who have lost two in a row.

"I thought we weathered a couple moments," Ottawa coach Travis Green said. "I really liked our second period. Our teams play a lot alike. I thought we started to apply a little bit of pressure. Obviously, we don’t like to give up two power-play goals on the road."

Carolina took a 1-0 lead at 8:00 of the first period. Martinook’s shot from behind the goal line handcuffed Forsberg and went into the net off his pads.

<forge-entity title="Sebastian Aho" slug="sebastian-aho-8478427" code="player">Sebastian Aho</forge-entity>'s power-play goal made it 2-0 at 19:18 of the second. He took a cross-ice pass from Necas and scored on a one-timer from the right face-off circle.

“Kind of a different set-up 5-on-3, there’s a little more time,” Aho said. “It was a good pass, and I’m glad I got some good wood on it and it went in.” 
<forge-entity title="Jackson Blake" slug="jackson-blake-8482809" code="player">Jackson Blake</forge-entity> gave the Hurricanes a 3-0 lead with a power-play goal just 43 seconds into the third. Forsberg stopped Gostisbehere’s wrist shot from inside the blue line, but Blake put in the rebound.

“If you’re not hunting pucks, what are you doing out there, right?” Blake said. “I feel like I really established that this year to kind of set the tone for me as a player. Hunting and winning those is a good thing for me.”

The Senators were 10-for-10 on the penalty kill in their previous four games.

“At the end of the day, our special teams have got to be better,” Ottawa defenseman <forge-entity title="Jake Sanderson" slug="jake-sanderson-8482105" code="player">Jake Sanderson</forge-entity> said. “And we’ve got to get more traffic in front of their goalie.”

<forge-entity title="William Carrier" slug="william-carrier-8477478" code="player">William Carrier</forge-entity> scored an empty-net goal for the 4-0 final at 15:04.

Martin made 11 saves in the third period to preserve the shutout. He stopped <forge-entity title="Nick Cousins" slug="nick-cousins-8476393" code="player">Nick Cousins</forge-entity> in close on a 2-on-1 before making a pad save on <forge-entity title="Tim Stutzle" slug="tim-stutzle-8482116" code="player">Tim Stutzle</forge-entity> cutting to the net. His best save came on a point-blank chance from <forge-entity title="Brady Tkachuk" slug="brady-tkachuk-8480801" code="player">Brady Tkachuk</forge-entity> with 33 seconds left.

“I thought they had a couple too many looks there at the end,” Aho said. “The game is kind of over, but you want to make sure he’s getting his shutout after that performance. He had to do it kind of himself at the end there too. Just an awesome game from him.”

**NOTES:** Forward <forge-entity title="David Perron" slug="david-perron-8474102" code="player">David Perron</forge-entity> had two shots on goal in 12:01 of ice time in his return for the Senators after missing 11 games to tend to family matters. … Tkachuk had seven shots and seven hits. … Martinook has eight points (six goals, two assists) in the past six games. … Hurricanes forward <forge-entity title="Jesperi Kotkaniemi" slug="jesperi-kotkaniemi-8480829" code="player">Jesperi Kotkaniemi</forge-entity> was 9-for-10 in face-offs. …The shutout was Carolina’s first of the season.

**Minnesota Wild 1 - 2 Dallas Stars**  
In a tightly contested game at the Xcel Energy Center, Mason Marchment's two-goal performance propelled the Dallas Stars to a 2-1 victory over the Minnesota Wild, marking their third consecutive win.

**Los Angeles Kings 4 - 1 Detroit Red Wings**  
In their 4-1 victory over the Detroit Red Wings, the Los Angeles Kings were propelled by Adrian Kempe, who scored two goals for the second consecutive game. The win at Crypto.com Arena was bolstered by David Rittich's 17 saves, helping the Kings improve their home record to 5-1-1. Trevor Lewis highlighted the team's focus on making their venue a challenging environment for opponents. Meanwhile, Cam Talbot made an impressive 37 saves for the Red Wings, who struggled with fatigue as they played their second game in as many nights. Key moments included Mikey Anderson's first-period goal, Tanner Jeannot's follow-up after returning from suspension, and Kempe's breakaway goal early in the third period. Despite some spirited play in the second period, Detroit was unable to keep pace, with Dylan Larkin's late goal merely averting a shutout. Additional highlights for the Kings included Trevor Moore extending his point streak to eight games and Anze Kopitar adding his sixth assist in four games. The Red Wings faced further challenges due to the absence of Simon Edvinsson and Michael Rasmussen due to injuries.
