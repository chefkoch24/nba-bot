In a dominant performance, the Los Angeles Lakers halted their three-game losing streak with a decisive 125-101 victory over the Sacramento Kings. Luka Doncic led the charge, scoring 34 points, while LeBron James added 24, connecting on an impressive 11 of 13 shots from the floor.

In the pivotal second quarter, Doncic notched 15 of his first-half points as the Lakers established a significant halftime lead. Despite DeMar DeRozan’s 22 points and six Kings players scoring in double figures, Sacramento couldn’t maintain their recent defensive improvements, allowing the Lakers to shoot 52.8% from the field. The Lakers face the Detroit Pistons next, while the Kings are set to play the Los Angeles Clippers.
