**Denver Nuggets 120 - 101 LA Clippers**  
The Denver Nuggets surged into the Western Conference semifinals with a dominant 120-101 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers in Game 7. This decisive win, marked by a 35-point lead and contributions from key players like Aaron Gordon and Christian Braun, exorcised the ghosts of last year's playoff collapse. Denver's balanced attack overshadowed Nikola Jokic's typically stellar performance, with contributions across the board, including Gordon's standout defense against James Harden. Despite Kawhi Leonard's 22-point effort, the Clippers couldn't withstand a relentless Nuggets team that outscored them heavily in the second and third quarters, highlighted by a 17-0 run. This win sets up a second-round clash with the top-seeded Oklahoma City Thunder, who boast an impressive 72-14 record, in a matchup that promises to be competitive. The game's backdrop included the firing of the Nuggets' head coach and general manager earlier in the season, and a supportive Clippers fan presence organized by team owner Steve Ballmer, though they were left stunned by Denver's overpowering performance.
