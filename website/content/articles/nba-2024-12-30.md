**Boston Celtics 114 - 123 Indiana Pacers**  
In a turn of events, the Indiana Pacers defeated the Boston Celtics 123-114 on Sunday night, after suffering a 37-point loss to them just two days prior. Tyrese Haliburton led the Pacers with 31 points, while Andrew Nembhard, returning from injury, contributed 17 points, eight rebounds, and eight assists.
