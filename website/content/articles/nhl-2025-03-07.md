Karel Vejmelka's standout performance, making 38 saves, led the Utah Hockey Club to a 4-2 comeback victory over the Detroit Red Wings at Little Caesars Arena. Vejmelka, fresh off signing a five-year contract extension, rebounded after conceding two early goals by halting the next 29 shots, helping Utah secure their fourth win in five games. Notably, Utah showcased a balanced team effort with ten players contributing at least one point, including Michael Kesselring with two assists, and pivotal goals from Nick Schmaltz, Kevin Stenlund, and Lawson Crouse.

Despite his efforts, Detroit suffered its fourth consecutive loss and couldn’t score in the final 51 minutes. The match also marked the first-ever meeting between the two teams, with Utah aiming to complete their games against all league teams when they face the Tampa Bay Lightning on March 22.

**Tampa Bay Lightning 6 - 5 Buffalo Sabres**  
In a thrilling game at Amalie Arena, the Tampa Bay Lightning clinched a 6-5 victory over the Buffalo Sabres, highlighted by Jake Guentzel's impressive second-period hat trick, marking his second this season and seventh career hat trick. The Lightning, now victorious in 10 of their last 11 games, saw Oliver Bjorkstrand score the game-winning goal in the third period, marking his debut with the team following a multi-team trade. Nikita Kucherov contributed two assists, while Andrei Vasilevskiy made 28 saves. Despite leading 5-3 in the second period with goals from Rasmus Dahlin, JJ Peterka, and Tage Thompson, the Sabres couldn't maintain the advantage, extending their losing streak to five games. A notably chaotic finish saw the Sabres fail to capitalize on a 6-on-3 advantage, with Erik Cernak blocking Thompson's final shot. The game was also marked by Lightning defenseman Victor Hedman's early exit due to unspecified reasons and Sabres forward Jack Quinn leaving with an illness shortly after the start.

**Florida Panthers 3 - 0 Columbus Blue Jackets**  
Bobrovsky, Panthers shut out Blue Jackets, push winning streak to 5
 **SUNRISE, Fla. --** <forge-entity title="Sergei Bobrovsky" slug="sergei-bobrovsky-8475683" code="player">Sergei Bobrovsky</forge-entity> made 16 saves, and the Florida Panthers won their fifth straight game with a 3-0 victory against the Columbus Blue Jackets at Amerant Bank Arena on Thursday. 
Bobrovsky got the 423rd win of his career, tying <forge-entity title="Tony Esposito" slug="tony-esposito-8446720" code="player">Tony Esposito</forge-entity> for 10th in NHL history. It was his fourth shutout of the season and second in his past three starts.

“It is a blessing to play in this league and to have the life I have,” Bobrovsky said. “I enjoy every moment I get to put the gear on and get to go out and play, whether it is practice or a game. I have fun with the guys, work for them, and try to be there when they need me. Again, it’s a privilege to be part of this team.”

As for the company Bobrovsky is keeping on the wins list, Florida coach Paul Maurice said, “Tony Esposito, right? He’s from my hometown (Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario), and I need to talk to \[Bobrovsky\] about that. … When we were growing up playing street hockey, you were either <forge-entity title="Ken Dryden" slug="ken-dryden-8446490" code="player">Ken Dryden</forge-entity> or Tony Esposito. Those were the two. The guys who picked first, always picked Tony. That’s a pretty good name.” 
<forge-entity title="Aleksander Barkov" slug="aleksander-barkov-8477493" code="player">Aleksander Barkov</forge-entity> and <forge-entity title="Sam Reinhart" slug="sam-reinhart-8477933" code="player">Sam Reinhart</forge-entity> each had a goal and two assists for the Panthers (39-21-3), who have won 10 of 12.

“We had a good first and second period, and we knew lately, our third hasn’t been that good,” said Barkov, the Florida captain. “We wanted to be a little better. They had a push, but we did a better job. We’re happy with that, and it helps us moving forward.”

<forge-entity title="Elvis Merzlikins" slug="elvis-merzlikins-8478007" code="player">Elvis Merzlikins</forge-entity> made 33 saves for the Blue Jackets (30-24-8), who lost their second straight and were outscored 9-2 during their two-game Florida trip. They lost 6-2 at the Tampa Bay Lightning on Tuesday to end a four-game winning streak.

“They did not allow us to get to our game,” Columbus coach Dean Evason said. “They played a strong game, smart, obviously. They did a lot of good things; we didn’t get in on the forecheck, we could have done more aggressive stuff … simplify our game a little. We complicated things early, and it kind of fed into how they play the game.”

The Panthers had a 69-41 advantage in shot attempts.

“It was good,” Maurice said. “We played well tonight. Deserved to win.” 
The Blue Jackets were 0-for-4 on the power play.

Asked what his team needed to do differently against Bobrovsky, Columbus captain <forge-entity title="Boone Jenner" slug="boone-jenner-8476432" code="player">Boone Jenner</forge-entity> said, “I don’t think we got enough action around him as far as making it difficult on him with screens and rebounds, and getting those secondary chances. I think that’s where you can get to teams and kind of wear them down that way.”

Reinhart gave Florida a 1-0 lead at 5:58 of the first period with a power-play goal. He took a pass from Barkov at the right hash marks, turned as he settled the puck and sent it over the stick of Merzlikins.

<forge-entity title="Mackie Samoskevich" slug="mackie-samoskevich-8482713" code="player">Mackie Samoskevich</forge-entity> made it 2-0 on the power play at 6:34 of the second period, scoring from the left of the net on the rebound of a Barkov shot when Merzlikins went low.

“Coming in, we knew we had to be around the net for second chances,” Samoskevich said, “and that’s what happened.”

Barkov scored into an empty net at 17:48 of the third period for the 3-0 final.

**NOTES:** Reinhart scored his 10th power-play goal of the season, giving him four seasons with double digits in that category for the Panthers. He passed <forge-entity title="Olli Jokinen" slug="olli-jokinen-8466140" code="player">Olli Jokinen</forge-entity> for the most such seasons in Florida history. Reinhart also scored his 26th game-winning goal, tying <forge-entity title="Jonathan Huberdeau" slug="jonathan-huberdeau-8476456" code="player">Jonathan Huberdeau</forge-entity> and Ekblad for third in Panthers history, and passed <forge-entity title="Pavel Bure" slug="pavel-bure-8455738" code="player">Pavel Bure</forge-entity> for fifth on the franchise goals list with 153. … Ekblad had an assist to extend his point streak to five games (six assists). … Samoskevich had a game-high seven shots on goal and scored for the fourth time in his past seven games. … <forge-entity title="Vitek Vanecek" slug="vitek-vanecek-8477970" code="player">Vitek Vanecek</forge-entity> backed up Bobrovsky after being acquired in a trade with the San Jose Sharks on Wednesday. … Blue Jackets forward <forge-entity title="Adam Fantilli" slug="adam-fantilli-8484166" code="player">Adam Fantilli</forge-entity> had a six-game point streak end.

**Carolina Hurricanes 3 - 2 Boston Bruins**  
In a thrilling showdown at Lenovo Center, Seth Jarvis scored a late game-winning goal with just 19 seconds left to secure a 3-2 victory for the Carolina Hurricanes against the Boston Bruins. The decisive goal came after Bruins defenseman Nikita Zadorov's stick broke, leaving Jarvis with an opportunity he confidently seized despite recent struggles. Earlier, Sebastian Aho had opened the scoring with a short-handed goal, marking his 20th career short-handed tally, placing him among elite company. Morgan Geekie scored both goals for Boston, equalizing twice, yet goalie Pyotr Kochetkov's 32 saves were pivotal in maintaining Carolina's edge. Though Carolina failed to convert any of their three power-play opportunities, the victory marked their third consecutive win, while the Bruins continued their slump, managing only one win in their last nine games.

**Nashville Predators 5 - 3 Seattle Kraken**  
In an exciting game at Bridgestone Arena, Filip Forsberg took center stage by scoring twice, leading the Nashville Predators to a 5-3 victory over the Seattle Kraken. Forsberg's performance was complemented by goals from Brady Skjei, Michael McCarron, and Luke Evangelista, as well as two assists from Steven Stamkos. Juuse Saros contributed with 22 critical saves, securing consecutive wins for the Predators. Despite Adam Larsson's early goal for the Kraken and Michael Eyssimont's debut goal after being traded from the Lightning, Seattle ultimately fell short, with Joey Daccord making 29 saves in the effort. The game was notable for Eyssimont's productive line synergy and Seattle's inability to maintain their initial momentum. Additionally, Michael Bunting, a newly-acquired forward for Nashville, was absent due to appendix surgery.
