**Indiana Pacers 89 - 108 Washington Wizards**  
In their first road win in nearly two months, the Washington Wizards defeated the Indiana Pacers 108-89, largely due to impressive performances from Marvin Bagley III, who notched a season-high 23 points and 13 rebounds, and CJ McCollum, who added 18 points. This marked Bagley's second double-double of the season, while Justin Champagnie contributed 13 points and 14 rebounds. The Wizards, improving to 2-11 on the road, snapped a four-game losing streak by playing stout defense, holding the short-handed Pacers to their second-worst shooting percentage of the season at 36.9% and a paltry 25.6% from beyond the arc. Indiana's Bennedict Mathurin led his team with 15 points, but their offense struggled, putting a delay on Coach Rick Carlisle's attempt to secure his 1,000th career win. Washington took control with a decisive 13-4 run to end the first half and maintained the lead throughout, sending the Pacers to their second straight loss. The Wizards continue their road trip against the San Antonio Spurs, while the Pacers prepare to host the New York Knicks in a much-anticipated rematch.

**Atlanta Hawks 120 - 117 Philadelphia 76ers**  
In a closely contested game, the Atlanta Hawks secured a 120-117 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers, largely thanks to Dyson Daniels' impressive performance with 27 points and 10 rebounds.

**Cleveland Cavaliers 111 - 119 Charlotte Hornets**  
The Charlotte Hornets emerged victorious against the Cleveland Cavaliers in a 119-111 overtime win, showcasing the prowess of rookie Kon Knueppel, who scored 29 points, and Brandon Miller, who contributed 25 points, a career-high 13 rebounds, and six assists. Charlotte achieved this rare road victory despite missing players like LaMelo Ball due to injuries. The Cavaliers, missing Evan Mobley and struggling with inconsistency, failed to score during the five-minute overtime, with Darius Garland scoring 26 points and Donovan Mitchell adding 17. Mitchell, after a near-win attempt in regulation, was visibly frustrated over the loss, as Cleveland succumbed to another disappointing defeat in their quest for Eastern Conference dominance. Despite recent setbacks and Mobley's injury absence, Cavaliers’ coach Kenny Atkinson expressed optimism about the team's future. Meanwhile, the Hornets, improving to 3-10 on the road, look forward to their next encounter against the Atlanta Hawks.

Egor Demin and Noah Clowney led the Nets in scoring with 17 and 16 points, respectively, as Brooklyn never trailed in the game. Despite missing head coach Jordi Fernandez due to illness, Assistant Coach Steve Hetzel successfully guided the team, marking the Nets' fourth win in six games after a challenging 3-13 start to the season. The Bucks played without their star, Giannis Antetokounmpo, who is sidelined with a right calf strain, contributing to their current struggles, winning only one of their last four games. Brooklyn's strong performance was highlighted by shooting 56.5% in the first half and an impressive third-quarter surge that sealed their commanding win.

**Minnesota Timberwolves 117 - 103 Sacramento Kings**  
The Minnesota Timberwolves secured a 117-103 victory over the Sacramento Kings, led by Julius Randle's 24 points and nine rebounds, despite missing star player Anthony Edwards. Jaden McDaniels and Naz Reid also made significant contributions, with Reid recording a double-double. The Timberwolves avenged an earlier defeat to the Kings by overcoming two significant scoreless stretches from Sacramento, a 14-0 run in the second quarter and a 15-0 burst in the third. Minnesota, now 17-9, excelled against teams with losing records and concluded their series against Sacramento with a 3-1 edge. The Kings, suffering with a 6-20 record and their worst winning percentage since 2008-09, faced additional setbacks with Zach LaVine's ankle injury. Keegan Murray's career-high five blocks highlighted their active defense, but it wasn't enough to avoid their 15th loss in 18 games.

**Portland Trail Blazers 136 - 131 Golden State Warriors**  
In a thrilling contest, the Portland Trail Blazers edged out the Golden State Warriors 136-131, ending a three-game skid. Jerami Grant and Shaedon Sharpe shone for Portland, each netting 35 points. Meanwhile, Stephen Curry dazzled with 48 points, including a season-high 12 three-pointers, marking the 28th time he's achieved 10 or more in a game. The game, a late addition due to both teams being eliminated from the NBA Cup, saw dramatic back-and-forth action in the final quarter. Notably, Curry was returning from a five-game absence and had also put up impressive scores in the Warriors' previous loss. Despite Curry's heroics, including clutch shots in the fourth quarter, Portland capitalized on key plays and free throws to secure their win. Draymond Green returned to the Warriors lineup but struggled with turnovers and a technical foul.

Despite a strong effort from Chicago's Coby White, who led his team with 20 points, and a 16-2 run that saw them briefly take the lead, the Bulls fell short, losing for the eighth time in nine games. Williamson's impactful return comes after missing five games due to a right hip adductor strain, one of four separate injuries limiting him to 11 games this season.

**Phoenix Suns 114 - 116 Los Angeles Lakers**  
In a thrilling encounter, the Los Angeles Lakers narrowly defeated the Phoenix Suns 116-114, overcoming a remarkable comeback by their opponents that erased a 20-point lead in the fourth quarter. LeBron James played a pivotal role in the win, scoring 26 points, including two crucial free throws with just 3.9 seconds remaining, which were enough to secure the victory after missing his first attempt. Luka Doncic contributed 29 points despite a challenging shooting night, and Jaxson Hayes delivered a memorable dunk as part of a 24-0 run, showcasing the Lakers' resilience. Dillon Brooks hit a go-ahead 3-pointer for the Suns but was ejected after receiving his second technical foul, which temporarily shifted momentum back to the Lakers. Suns' Devin Booker, back from a groin injury, led his team with 27 points but couldn't secure the win despite hitting 13 free throws, and Grayson Allen's last-second shot fell short. The Lakers' dominance on the boards, with a season-high 24 offensive rebounds, and Deandre Ayton's solid performance against his former team, were also key factors in the win.
