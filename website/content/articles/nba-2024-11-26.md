**Charlotte Hornets 84 - 95 Orlando Magic**  
In a tightly contested game, the Orlando Magic defeated the Charlotte Hornets 95-84, despite a standout 44-point performance from LaMelo Ball. Franz Wagner led the Magic with 21 points, including 13 crucial points in the fourth quarter, while Jonathan Isaac contributed three key corner 3-pointers in the final period. Orlando capitalized on Charlotte's 27 turnovers, converting them into 33 points, and outscored the Hornets' bench 53-15. Despite shooting just 39% from the field, Orlando managed to overpower a short-handed Charlotte team, missing several key players and having its four-game home win streak snapped. The Hornets struggled offensively, with Ball and Brandon Miller, who had 20 points and 10 rebounds, shouldering much of the effort. Gary Harris of the Magic left early due to a hamstring injury, and the absence of the Hornets' top centers led to extended minutes for their starters and rookies, impacting the team's on-court chemistry.

**Detroit Pistons 102 - 100 Toronto Raptors**  
Jaden Ivey hit a dramatic game-winning jumper at the buzzer to lift the Detroit Pistons to a 102-100 victory over the Toronto Raptors. Despite a clutch three-pointer from RJ Barrett that put Toronto ahead late in the game, Ivey tied the score with a layup and later drove past Ochai Agbaji for the winning shot, finishing with 25 points. The Raptors, led by Scottie Barnes' 31 points, initially struggled as their starters, except Barnes, managed only eight points combined in the first half. Barnes kept Toronto competitive, scoring 20 first-half points. The Raptors dominated the boards with 23 offensive rebounds to the Pistons’ six but couldn't capitalize on crucial shots. Notably, Ausur Thompson returned to the Pistons lineup after an eight-month hiatus due to blood-clotting issues, receiving significant fan support. Both teams face quick turnarounds, with Detroit traveling to Memphis and Toronto heading to New Orleans next.

**Indiana Pacers 114 - 110 New Orleans Pelicans**  
Tyrese Haliburton delivered a spectacular performance with 34 points and 13 assists, guiding the Indiana Pacers to a 114-100 victory over the injury-depleted New Orleans Pelicans.

Myles Turner contributed significantly with 17 points, swinging momentum in the Pacers' favor during the fourth quarter. Despite a strong 24-point effort from Trey Murphy III and CJ McCollum's 23 points in his return, the Pelicans suffered their fifth consecutive loss. Notably, Elfrid Payton recorded a career-high 21 assists, the most by any player in an NBA game this season. The game saw WNBA star Caitlin Clark in attendance, much to the delight of fans.

**Atlanta Hawks 119 - 129 Dallas Mavericks**  
In a game without their star player Luka Doncic, the Dallas Mavericks defeated the Atlanta Hawks 129-119, with Kyrie Irving leading the charge with 32 points, six assists, and seven rebounds. Jaden Hardy, in his first start of the season, contributed a season-high 23 points, while Naji Marshall and Spencer Dinwiddie added 22 points each. Irving, initially quiet due to tight defense from Dyson Daniels, exploded in the second half, scoring 14 points in a critical three-minute stretch that turned a deficit into a lead. Despite missing Doncic, who had previously tallied 73 points in Dallas’ sole visit to Atlanta last season, and playing their second game in as many nights, the Mavericks managed to secure the win. The Hawks, who had Jalen Johnson scoring 28 points and Trae Young with a double-double of 18 points and 16 assists, have now lost four of their last five games. They will face the top-ranked Cavaliers next, while the Mavericks prepare to host the New York Knicks.

Jayson Tatum and Payton Pritchard each contributed 20 points, while Kristaps Porzingis made his season debut, scoring 16 points and adding six rebounds and two blocks, following offseason ankle surgery. Despite a short-lived rally by the Clippers in the third quarter, Boston quickly regained control with a series of three-pointers. Ivica Zubac led the Clippers with 23 points and 10 rebounds, while James Harden narrowly missed a triple-double. Notably, the Celtics tied the NBA record for three-point makes in a quarter, going 12 for 17 from deep in the second quarter, transforming a modest seven-point lead into a commanding 19-point halftime advantage. The loss snapped the Clippers' five-game win streak as they continue their road trip against the Washington Wizards, while the Celtics prepare to visit the Chicago Bulls.

**Memphis Grizzlies 123 - 98 Portland Trail Blazers**  
In his return from a hip injury, Ja Morant led the Memphis Grizzlies to a decisive 123-98 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers, contributing 22 points and 11 assists. Morant's presence rejuvenated the Grizzlies' offense despite limited fast-break opportunities. Jaren Jackson Jr. added 21 points, while Santi Aldama achieved a career-high 17 rebounds along with 13 points. Despite Deni Avdija's 17 points, eight rebounds, and six assists for Portland, and Shaedon Sharpe's 15 points, the Trail Blazers struggled dramatically with their shooting, only making 8 of 46 from beyond the arc. Portland's offensive woes continued, with their shooting percentage at just 33%, marking their third loss in four games. Morant's influence was highlighted by a stunning, albeit late, three-quarters court shot that didn't count, keeping Memphis ahead 65-54 at halftime. The Grizzlies will host Detroit next, while the Trail Blazers face Indiana in their upcoming game.

**Denver Nuggets 118 - 145 New York Knicks**  
In a commanding display, the New York Knicks triumphed over the Denver Nuggets with a resounding 145-118 victory, propelled by OG Anunoby's career-high 40 points and Jalen Brunson's team record-tying 45 assists. Brunson, who also contributed 23 points, helped the Knicks match their single-game assist record from 1979. The Knicks set the pace early, leading by 12 points after the first quarter and extending the lead to as much as 30, while shooting an impressive 60.9% from the field. Despite a sore calf, Karl-Anthony Towns made a significant impact for New York with 30 points and 15 rebounds, continuing his strong performances against Denver, having eliminated them in last season's playoffs with Minnesota. Reserve Russell Westbrook added 27 points, and Nikola Jokic posted 22 points for the Nuggets, who surprisingly dropped to a 5-4 home record.

**Golden State Warriors 120 - 128 Brooklyn Nets**  
The Brooklyn Nets secured a 108-103 victory over the Sacramento Kings, thanks to their bench contributing 44 points, led by Noah Clowney's 18 points and Shake Milton's 10. Brooklyn's reserves, playing significant minutes, were instrumental in the win as they outperformed Sacramento's bench 44-9. This performance highlights the Nets' adaptation to new coach Jordi Fernandez's up-tempo style, emphasizing defense and three-point shooting. Despite losing a 19-point lead, the Nets managed their second win in three games, a promising sign for a team that won only 32 games last season. As they prepare to visit the Golden State Warriors, who have secured a spot in the Western semifinals of the NBA Cup, the Warriors are dealing with inconsistent performances, highlighted by Stephen Curry's recent scoring decline, contrasted with Andrew Wiggins' improved shooting. Historically, the Brooklyn-Golden State season series often results in sweeps, adding intrigue to their upcoming matchup.

**Sacramento Kings 109 - 130 Oklahoma City Thunder**  
The Oklahoma City Thunder secured a 109-99 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers, with Isaiah Hartenstein making a significant impact in his season debut. Filling in for star center Chet Holmgren, who is sidelined with a fractured pelvis, Hartenstein delivered 13 points, 14 rebounds, and four blocked shots in 29 minutes off the bench. Despite missing the first 15 games due to a broken hand, Hartenstein's performance underscored his crucial role, especially with a hefty three-year, $87 million free-agent contract. Meanwhile, the Sacramento Kings struggled in their game against the Brooklyn Nets, allowing 19 3-pointers and committing 16 turnovers, leading to a 108-103 defeat. De'Aaron Fox shone with 31 points but failed to score in the fourth quarter, while teammate Domantas Sabonis recorded 13 points and 18 rebounds, yet struggled offensively alongside DeMar DeRozan in the final stretch. The Thunder are set for a challenging road stint, playing 10 of their next 12 games away, while the Kings aim to rebound from a three-game losing streak.
