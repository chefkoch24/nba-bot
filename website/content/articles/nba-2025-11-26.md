**Washington Wizards 132 - 113 Atlanta Hawks**  
The Washington Wizards, led by CJ McCollum's season-high 46 points and 10 three-pointers, defeated the Atlanta Hawks 132-113, never trailing in the game. McCollum was one three-pointer short of matching his career best and the franchise record. The Wizards' explosive offense resulted in a 45-point first quarter and a 77-point first half, both season highs, helping them snap a 14-game losing streak and earn their first home victory since April. Alex Sarr contributed with a double-double of 27 points and 11 rebounds, while Corey Kispert added 19 points before exiting with a thumb injury. Kristaps Porzingis scored 22 points for the Wizards, while Atlanta's Onyeka Okongwu had 20 points. The Wizards' dominant start saw them hitting their first seven three-pointers, establishing a lead that peaked at 33 points. This win improved both teams to a 1-2 record in NBA Cup play, with Atlanta hosting Cleveland next and Washington heading to Indiana.

**Los Angeles Lakers 95 - 93 LA Clippers**  
In a highly anticipated NBA Cup matchup, the Los Angeles Clippers will face the Los Angeles Lakers, with James Harden aiming to extend his recent offensive surge. Harden, who scored a franchise-record 55 points against the Charlotte Hornets, has averaged 33.6 points over his last eight games but saw a dip in performance with just 19 points and zero 3-pointers in a loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers. Despite Harden's individual success, the Clippers have struggled lately, losing 10 of their past 12 games. The Lakers, on the other hand, have won four straight with LeBron James returning from injury to contribute solid performances, averaging 14 points, 10 assists, and 4.5 rebounds against the Utah Jazz. Luka Doncic has also been a key figure for the Lakers, leading the league with 34.5 points per game, but both teams have faced challenges with 3-point shooting accuracy. Clippers' coach Tyronn Lue and Lakers' coach JJ Redick are both optimistic their teams can overcome these setbacks. The contest marks the start of a four-game series between the two teams, with the Lakers holding a favorable record from last season.
