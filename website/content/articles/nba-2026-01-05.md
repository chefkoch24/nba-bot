**Orlando Magic 135 - 127 Indiana Pacers**  
In a high-scoring battle, the Orlando Magic defeated the Indiana Pacers 135-127 in Orlando, marking the Pacers' twelfth consecutive loss and tying a 43-year-old franchise record.

The Pacers outperformed their usual shooting stats, hitting 55.2% from the field, yet it wasn't enough to overcome the Magic's sharp 56% shooting and 46.9% accuracy from beyond the arc. A crucial 17-0 run reversed the Pacers’ early 12-point advantage, and although Siakam narrowed the gap with an impressive 20-point third quarter, the Magic regained control late in the game following decisive plays from Bane and Banchero. Notably, the Magic's victory came without Jalen Suggs due to a knee injury, while the Pacers were missing Bennedict Mathurin, sidelined by a thumb injury.
