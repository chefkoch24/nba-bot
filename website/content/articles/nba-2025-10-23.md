**New York Knicks 119 - 111 Cleveland Cavaliers**  
The New York Knicks, in their first game under coach Mike Brown, defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 119-111, with OG Anunoby leading the team with 24 points and 14 rebounds. Jalen Brunson contributed 23 points, and Karl-Anthony Towns added 19 points and 11 rebounds. The Knicks initially led by 17 points in the first half, then rebounded after falling behind to a Donovan Mitchell-led Cavaliers comeback in the third quarter. The Knicks regained control with a 14-0 run in the fourth quarter. Mitchell was a standout for the Cavaliers, scoring 31 points, including an impressive 21 in the third quarter, but his efforts weren't enough to secure a win. Both teams, missing key players due to injuries, are seen as contenders in the East, though it's early in the season. This victory follows the Knicks' surprising decision to replace Tom Thibodeau with Brown after reaching the Eastern Conference finals last season. The Knicks are slated to host Boston next, while the Cavaliers will visit Brooklyn.

**Dallas Mavericks 92 - 125 San Antonio Spurs**  
In a highly anticipated matchup, Victor Wembanyama shone in his return to the court, leading the San Antonio Spurs to a commanding 125-92 victory over the Dallas Mavericks. Wembanyama, who had previously been sidelined by a shoulder condition, delivered a spectacular performance with 40 points, 15 rebounds, and three blocks. His efforts overshadowed the NBA debut of Cooper Flagg, the Mavericks' No. 1 overall pick, who managed 10 points and 10 rebounds after a slow start. The game marked Flagg as the second-youngest player to start an NBA debut since LeBron James. Dylan Harper and reigning Rookie of the Year Stephon Castle also contributed significantly to the Spurs' success. Despite Anthony Davis’s strong performance with 22 points and 13 rebounds, Dallas struggled without star guard Kyrie Irving, who is recovering from ACL surgery. Wembanyama's dominance, highlighted by a pivotal 13-0 run and several dazzling plays, was the standout storyline of the game.

Suggs also netted a short jumper in the final minute to secure the Magic's lead. With Tyler Herro absent due to recent ankle surgery, Miami fell short in the highest-scoring quarter (39-38) in their 143-game series history. The Magic now look forward to hosting Atlanta, while the Heat will visit Memphis in their next games.

Meanwhile, Boston's Jaylen Brown, fresh from a preseason hamstring injury, scored an impressive 25 points, stepping up for an injured Jayson Tatum, who is recovering from an Achilles tendon rupture.

In a season-opening victory, Giannis Antetokounmpo propelled the Milwaukee Bucks with an impressive 37 points and 14 rebounds, leading his team to a 133-120 win over the Washington Wizards. Despite a strong start, the game was marred by an early injury to Milwaukee's Kevin Porter Jr., who exited with a sprained ankle in the first quarter.

**Phoenix Suns 120 - 116 Sacramento Kings**  
In their season opener against the Sacramento Kings, the Phoenix Suns leaned heavily on veteran guard Devin Booker, the only returning starter from a lineup that has failed to secure a playoff win since 2023. Despite notable changes, including a new coach, Jordan Ott, and the departures of Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal, the Suns have bolstered their roster with Jalen Green, Dillon Brooks, and center Mark Williams. Ott emphasized the evolving nature of the game's playmaking roles, which influenced the team’s strategic setup. Meanwhile, the Kings, under new coach Doug Christie, grappled with significant injuries as both Domantas Sabonis and Keegan Murray are sidelined, and they also welcomed veteran Russell Westbrook, who signed a one-year deal to provide a boost amidst these challenges. This game marks a new chapter for both teams as they navigate their restructured rosters and coaching changes in hopes of improving their postseason prospects.
