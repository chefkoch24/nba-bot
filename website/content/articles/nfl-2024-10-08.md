**Kansas City Chiefs 26 - 13 New Orleans Saints**  
In a Monday night matchup at Arrowhead Stadium, the Kansas City Chiefs defeated the New Orleans Saints 26-13, with Patrick Mahomes throwing for 331 yards. Travis Kelce was a key target, catching nine passes for 70 yards, while Kareem Hunt returned to form with 102 rushing yards and a touchdown. The Chiefs, now 5-0, were bolstered by a strong defensive performance that limited Saints quarterback Derek Carr to 185 passing yards before he left with an injury. JuJu Smith-Schuster's significant 50-yard catch set up a crucial Xavier Worthy rushing touchdown in the fourth quarter. Kansas City's ability to stymie high-profile running backs continued as Alvin Kamara struggled, adding to the Chiefs' impressive defensive track record. The game coincided with the Kansas City Royals tying their AL Division Series against the Yankees, adding to the local excitement. Taylor Swift's presence at the game, to support Kelce, added a touch of celebrity interest, while both teams dealt with injuries affecting key players. New Orleans will host Tampa Bay next, and Kansas City will have a bye week before visiting San Francisco.
