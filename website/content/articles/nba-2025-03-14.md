**Detroit Pistons 125 - 129 Washington Wizards**  
In a thrilling NBA matchup, the Washington Wizards edged out the Detroit Pistons 129-125, thanks to Alex Sarr's decisive performance in the game's final minute. Sarr not only scored the go-ahead basket with 53 seconds remaining but also made a crucial block on Cade Cunningham's dunk attempt, highlighting his 19-point contribution. Justin Champagnie and Kyshawn George also played vital roles, with George scoring all his nine points in the fourth quarter through three clutch 3-pointers. Despite a stellar 38-point, 10-rebound effort from Cade Cunningham and a double-double from Jalen Duren, the Pistons couldn't sustain their momentum, missing all eight of their fourth-quarter 3-point attempts. The Wizards, who shot an impressive 61% from the floor in the last quarter, rebounded from a previous loss to Detroit with sharper play. Notably, Jaden Ivey's ongoing recovery from a fractured tibia dampens Detroit's outlook, as he aims to return for the playoffs. Both teams are set for Saturday action, with Washington visiting Denver and Detroit hosting Oklahoma City.

**Milwaukee Bucks 126 - 106 Los Angeles Lakers**  
In a matchup against a depleted Los Angeles Lakers team, the Milwaukee Bucks ended their three-game losing streak with a 126-106 win, highlighted by Giannis Antetokounmpo's near triple-double of 24 points, 12 rebounds, and nine assists. Despite Luka Doncic's impressive 45-point and 11-rebound performance, which marked his season high since joining the Lakers, the Bucks capitalized on their depth and managed a significant 45-20 advantage in bench scoring led by Kevin Porter Jr.'s swift 22 points in only 17 minutes. Brook Lopez contributed 23 points, while Damian Lillard bolstered the Bucks with 22 points, 10 assists, and six rebounds. The Lakers, playing without LeBron James, Rui Hachimura, and Jaxson Hayes due to injuries, struggled against Milwaukee's height and depth, which proved decisive as the Bucks pulled away with a dominant 24-7 run in the third quarter. With LeBron and others ruled out for the Lakers' game against Denver, Los Angeles faces continued challenges in their current road trip.
