**Indiana Pacers 117 - 122 Detroit Pistons**  
The Detroit Pistons extended their winning streak to 13 games, tying the franchise record, by beating the Indiana Pacers 122-117 in Indianapolis. Cade Cunningham led the Pistons with 24 points and 11 rebounds, while Caris LeVert contributed 19 points and Jalen Duren added 17 points and 12 rebounds. Notably, this streak matches the team’s runs in their 1989-90 and 2003-04 championship years, despite the fact that just two seasons ago, they set an NBA record with 28 consecutive losses. The victory solidified Detroit's strong start to the season with a 15-2 record. Despite being down by 18 points early in the fourth quarter, the injury-hit Pacers, led by Pascal Siakam's 24 points, managed to cut the deficit to two points. Bennedict Mathurin had a chance to tie the game but missed a critical 3-pointer with 11 seconds left. Indiana continued to struggle without their star guard, Tyrese Haliburton, who remains sidelined after tearing his right Achilles. The Pistons will next face Boston in an NBA Cup game, while the Pacers will meet Toronto.

**Toronto Raptors 110 - 99 Cleveland Cavaliers**  
The Toronto Raptors secured their eighth consecutive victory by defeating the Cleveland Cavaliers 110-99, with Brandon Ingram delivering a standout performance of 37 points, 15 of which came in a dominant third quarter.

Notably, the Raptors completed a season sweep against the Cavaliers for the first time since the 2019-20 season. Cleveland struggled offensively, with Donovan Mitchell scoring 17 points but hitting only 6 of 20 shots. Toronto overcame the absence of RJ Barrett, sidelined with a knee sprain, by closing the first half with a decisive 13-2 run. The Cavaliers faced their own challenges, missing several key players, including Jarrett Allen, due to injury. Despite this, Toronto's defense and effective gameplay allowed them to close out the match confidently, with Jakob Poeltl’s return further bolstering the team's efforts.

In a dominant display, the New York Knicks secured a 113-100 victory over the Brooklyn Nets at Barclays Center, marking their 12th consecutive win against their crosstown rivals.

Brooklyn's Noah Clowney achieved a career-high with 31 points, but it wasn't enough to overcome the Knicks. Key in the Knicks' triumph was a third-quarter surge where they outscored the Nets 38-27, propelled by Towns and Mikal Bridges' combined scoring efforts. The loss leaves the Nets winless at home this season, further emphasizing the Knicks' recent dominance in this New York rivalry.

**Miami Heat 106 - 102 Dallas Mavericks**  
In a thrilling game, Tyler Herro returned from ankle surgery to score 24 points, including the decisive basket, in the Miami Heat's 106-102 victory over the Dallas Mavericks. Herro's clutch performance helped Miami overcome the absence of key players like Norman Powell, Andrew Wiggins, and Nikola Jovic due to injuries. Kel’el Ware significantly contributed with 20 points and 18 rebounds, while Bam Adebayo added 17 points. Despite being held almost 20 points below their season average, the Heat improved to 8-1 at home. Dallas, which was missing Anthony Davis for the 14th consecutive game due to a calf strain, made a late push to tie the game at 102-102 following free throws by Cooper Flagg. However, a critical steal by Adebayo set up Herro's winning bucket, thwarting the Mavericks' comeback bid. P.J. Washington led the Mavericks with 27 points, as Dallas now looks ahead to facing the Los Angeles Lakers on Friday.

**Phoenix Suns 92 - 114 Houston Rockets**  
The Houston Rockets snapped the Phoenix Suns' three-game winning streak with a 114-92 victory, even without star forward Kevin Durant, who missed the game for personal reasons. Amen Thompson led the Rockets with 28 points, eight assists, and seven rebounds, while Aaron Holiday contributed 22 points off the bench, making six 3-pointers. The Rockets, who have won 11 of their last 13 games and five straight against the Suns, were in control from the beginning and maintained their lead throughout the night. Despite Dillon Brooks scoring 29 points for the Suns, Phoenix struggled with turnovers, allowing Houston to capitalize on 26 points from 20 turnovers. The Suns’ 92 points marked a season low, and the result was a bit of a disappointment after the news that Durant wouldn’t be playing against his former team, following his offseason trade to Houston in a seven-team deal.

The Warriors, overcoming an initial 11-0 deficit, surged ahead with a 17-3 run and secured a 67-55 lead by halftime, thanks in part to a 41-point second quarter. Curry's performance marked his fifth 30-point game in the last six outings. Despite a promising 28-point effort from Utah's Keyonte George, the Jazz recorded their fourth consecutive loss and remain winless on the road against Western Conference teams this season. The Warriors debuted their "The Town" edition jerseys and a themed court, celebrating their Oakland history. Notably, Golden State extended their winning streak at home against the Jazz to ten games. Draymond Green missed the game due to a minor foot injury, while Jonathan Kuminga remained sidelined.

Russell Westbrook and Dennis Schroder each scored 21 points, with Westbrook delivering a strong fourth-quarter performance against his former team.
