**Los Angeles Lakers 130 - 120 Miami Heat**  
In a thrilling matchup, the Los Angeles Lakers secured a 117-112 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies, bolstered by Luka Doncic’s remarkable 44-point performance upon his return from injury.

Even without LeBron James, yet to play due to sciatica, the Lakers rallied from a 69-55 halftime deficit. Austin Reaves has been a key contributor, averaging 32.0 points through six games and hitting a game-winning buzzer-beater against the Timberwolves.
