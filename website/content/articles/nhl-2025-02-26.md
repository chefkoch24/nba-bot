In an intense and captivating matchup, Mitch Marner scored his second goal of the game in overtime to lead the Toronto Maple Leafs to a 5-4 comeback victory over the Boston Bruins at TD Garden. The Maple Leafs displayed resilience by overcoming a three-goal deficit, capped by Pontus Holmberg's game-tying goal with just 46 seconds left in regulation. Morgan Rielly contributed a goal and three assists for Toronto, marking his 500th NHL point. Meanwhile, David Pastrnak's outstanding two-goal performance extended his point streak to an NHL career-high 15 games, though the Bruins ultimately suffered their fourth consecutive loss.

**Montreal Canadiens 4 - 0 Carolina Hurricanes**  
Montembeault makes 20 saves, Canadiens shut out Hurricanes
 **MONTREAL --** The Montreal Canadiens won consecutive games for the first time in a month with a 4-0 win against the Carolina Hurricanes at Bell Centre on Tuesday. 
<forge-entity title="Sam Montembeault" slug="sam-montembeault-8478470" code="player">Sam Montembeault</forge-entity> made 20 saves for his fourth shutout, and <forge-entity title="Patrik Laine" slug="patrik-laine-8479339" code="player">Patrik Laine</forge-entity> and <forge-entity title="Nick Suzuki" slug="nick-suzuki-8480018" code="player">Nick Suzuki</forge-entity> each had a goal and two assists for Montreal (27-26-5), which went 1-7-1 in nine games prior to the 4 Nations Face-Off break.

“I think we’re just playing more of a complete game,” Montembeault said. “We played a really solid 60 minutes today. Sorry for the fans, maybe it wasn’t the most exciting game of the year, but we played a really solid game and really simple game. That’s a team that brings a lot of pressure and we did a really good job of getting the puck out of our zone.”

The Canadiens, who defeated the Ottawa Senators 5-2 on Saturday, last won consecutive games to cap a run of 25 points (12-3-1) in 16 games from Dec. 17 to Jan. 21.

“I think we’ve played some pretty solid hockey,” Laine said. “Obviously in Ottawa it was a tighter game, but I think we played in a similar way both nights and obviously two wins right away it’s huge for us from where we stand.” 
<forge-entity title="Frederik Andersen" slug="frederik-andersen-8475883" code="player">Frederik Andersen</forge-entity> made 14 saves for Carolina (33-21-4), which lost 6-3 at the Toronto Maple Leafs on Saturday and are 1-5-0 in their past six games.

“It’s been a bit of the same story,” Hurricanes coach Rod Brind’Amour said. “It’s not that we’re giving up a ton but when we do it just seemed to kind of find a way, you know, a couple of weird bounces to start and then you’re behind the eight ball. You’ve got to give them credit, they didn’t give us much. They were doing a nice job of defending when they got the lead.”

<forge-entity title="Juraj Slafkovsky" slug="juraj-slafkovsky-8483515" code="player">Juraj Slafkovsky</forge-entity> put Montreal up 1-0 at 8:05 of the first period. He deflected <forge-entity title="Jayden Struble" slug="jayden-struble-8481593" code="player">Jayden Struble</forge-entity>’s wrist shot from the left point in the goalmouth to score for the second straight game.

Laine made it 2-0 at 17:37 when he tipped <forge-entity title="Alexandre Carrier" slug="alexandre-carrier-8478851" code="player">Alexandre Carrier</forge-entity>’s shot from the point for his 14th goal in 30 games. 
Suzuki pushed it to 3-0 with a power-play goal at 10:04 of the second period. He fired a wrist shot past Andersen’s glove from above the right face-off dot after taking a cross-ice pass from Laine.

“I feel like whenever I’ve played them throughout my career, they’ve always had a healthy PK,” Laine said. “We try to keep it simple. There were a couple of breakdowns they had and obviously we were able to capitalize, which was nice, which gives us confidence for our power play, and it’ll be a major part for our success, you know, trying to get the PP going in these last 24 games.”

<forge-entity title="Lane Hutson" slug="lane-hutson-8483457" code="player">Lane Hutson</forge-entity> made it 4-0 with Montreal’s second straight power-play goal at 10:22 of the third period with a wrist shot through traffic from the left point. The defenseman leads NHL rookies with 43 points (four goals, 39 assists).

“We’re starting off games down a couple and chasing is never a recipe for success,” Hurricanes captain <forge-entity title="Jordan Staal" slug="jordan-staal-8473533" code="player">Jordan Staal</forge-entity>. “I just didn’t think we were defending well enough. We’re kind of hoping to outscore teams and hoping to out-chance teams and playing that 50/50, you know, if we get more goals than them kind of thing. We’ve always been built on a club that defends well, and I think we’ve slipped in that aspect of our game.”
