**Montreal Canadiens 6 - 1 Buffalo Sabres**  
In a dominant 6-1 victory over the Buffalo Sabres, Patrik Laine's hat trick led the Montreal Canadiens, marking Buffalo's 11th consecutive loss. Laine's impressive performance included three power-play goals, bringing his total to six power-play goals in seven games since his debut with Montreal. Despite claiming it as an average game, Laine noted his success on the power play. Juraj Slafkovsky contributed with a goal and an assist, with Nick Suzuki and Lane Hutson each providing two assists. This win propelled Montreal ahead of Buffalo in the Atlantic Division standings. The Sabres' only goal came from Dylan Cozens, as they have been winless since November 23. Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen and James Reimer shared goaltending duties for Buffalo, while Joel Armia scored just 19 seconds in to energize the Canadiens. Laine's hat trick also saw him surpass Mikko Rantanen for the third-most hat tricks by a Finland-born player.

**Tampa Bay Lightning 5 - 3 Columbus Blue Jackets**  
In a thrilling match at Amalie Arena, the Tampa Bay Lightning staved off a late rally from the Columbus Blue Jackets to secure a 5-3 victory. Jake Guentzel not only extended his goal streak to seven games but also contributed with an assist, pushing his tally to nine goals in the streak, the longest for any player this season. Nick Paul was instrumental with a goal and two assists, as the Lightning raced to a 4-0 lead by the second period, thanks in part to Mitchell Chaffee's power-play goal. Despite a spirited comeback attempt by the Blue Jackets in the third period, with goals from Mikael Pyythia, Adam Fantilli, and Cole Sillinger, the Lightning held firm. Andrei Vasilevskiy’s 28 saves, coupled with Brayden Point’s empty-net goal, sealed the win for Tampa Bay, who have now triumphed in five of their last six games. Notably, Columbus, winless in their past five, has never achieved a four-goal comeback victory in their history.

**Pittsburgh Penguins 3 - 2 Los Angeles Kings**  
The Pittsburgh Penguins mounted an impressive comeback to defeat the Los Angeles Kings 3-2 in overtime, with Rickard Rakell securing the win just 1:44 into OT by tipping in a shot from Erik Karlsson. Matt Grzelcyk tied the game late in the third period with his first goal of the season, while Evgeni Malkin scored his seventh of the season to initially level the game in the second period. Alex Nedeljkovic played a crucial role with 29 saves, and Michael Bunting marked his 300th NHL game with two assists. For the Kings, Adrian Kempe and Alex Turcotte scored, with Kempe's goal marking his 16th of the season and Turcotte's his fourth. Despite this effort, LA couldn't hold off Pittsburgh's late surge. The win was significant for the Penguins as it marked their 64th overtime victory since the inception of the 3-on-3 format in 2015-16, tying them with the Chicago Blackhawks and St. Louis Blues for the most such victories. King's goalie Darcy Kuemper, fresh from returning from injury, made 28 saves, but it wasn't enough to secure the win, leaving LA coach Jim Hiller noting a reliance on Kuemper during the game. Notably, the Penguins had battle-hardened resilience, as highlighted by head coach Mike Sullivan's praise for his team's perseverance and strategy against adversity.

**Carolina Hurricanes 4 - 0 New York Islanders**  
Kochetkov, Hurricanes shut out Islanders
 **RALEIGH, N.C. --** <forge-entity title="Pyotr Kochetkov" slug="pyotr-kochetkov-8481611" code="player">Pyotr Kochetkov</forge-entity> made 32 saves for the Carolina Hurricanes in a 4-0 win against the New York Islanders at Lenovo Center on Tuesday. 
“He was obviously the best player tonight,” Carolina coach Rod Brind’Amour said. “We gave up more than I would like to see and we were a little loosey. That sometimes happens when you get an early lead; it’s hard to stick with it. He was great all night. Looked like he was dialed right in.”

<forge-entity title="Sebastian Aho" slug="sebastian-aho-8478427" code="player">Sebastian Aho</forge-entity> had a goal and assist, and <forge-entity title="Shayne Gostisbehere" slug="shayne-gostisbehere-8476906" code="player">Shayne Gostisbehere</forge-entity> had two assists for the Hurricanes (20-10-1), who have won two in a row. Kochetkov got his first shutout of the season and ninth in the NHL.

“I’m happy today to have the shutout,” Kochetkov said. “I tried to not think about \[the shutout until\] about seven minutes in the last period. I had a couple ideas about this: I think, just stay in net and relax and do your job. I just want to win and not think about the shutout.” 
<forge-entity title="Ilya Sorokin" slug="ilya-sorokin-8478009" code="player">Ilya Sorokin</forge-entity> allowed four goals on 23 shots through two periods for the Islanders (12-14-7), who have lost three of four. <forge-entity title="Marcus Hogberg" slug="marcus-hogberg-8477405" code="player">Marcus Hogberg</forge-entity> made six saves in relief.

“That's a team that does a really good job around the net, and they were better than us,” New York coach Patrick Roy said. “We did some good things out there. We outshot them. It's something that's pretty tough to do in that building.”

<forge-entity title="Andrei Svechnikov" slug="andrei-svechnikov-8480830" code="player">Andrei Svechnikov</forge-entity>’s power-play goal gave Carolina a 1-0 lead at 5:47 of the first period. He took a pass from Aho along the goal line on the right side, skated toward the net and stuffed the puck through Sorokin’s five-hole. 
<forge-entity title="Jordan Martinook" slug="jordan-martinook-8476921" code="player">Jordan Martinook</forge-entity> made it 2-0 at 8:21. Sorokin kicked away <forge-entity title="Jordan Staal" slug="jordan-staal-8473533" code="player">Jordan Staal</forge-entity>’s shot from in close, but Martinook tapped in the rebound at the top of the crease.

“The second goal, we win a face-off, and then get on the wrong side and kind of just lose coverage, and it's in the back of the net,” Islanders forward <forge-entity title="Brock Nelson" slug="brock-nelson-8475754" code="player">Brock Nelson</forge-entity> said. “So, I mean \[they're\] mistakes that I feel are so correctable at the same time.”

<forge-entity title="Tyson Jost" slug="tyson-jost-8479370" code="player">Tyson Jost</forge-entity> pushed the lead to 3-0 at 11:13 of the second period. He forced a turnover by <forge-entity title="Casey Cizikas" slug="casey-cizikas-8475231" code="player">Casey Cizikas</forge-entity> behind the Islanders net, then moved in front, where he batted in the rebound of Gostisbehere’s shot.

“That’s a huge part of my game, getting in on the forecheck and creating turnovers, creating havoc out there,” Jost said. “It’s something I’ve got to bring to my game, and I feel like I’m doing that really well. So it’s nice to get rewarded for that.”

Aho extended it to 4-0 at 19:44 when he finished a give-and-go with <forge-entity title="Eric Robinson" slug="eric-robinson-8480762" code="player">Eric Robinson</forge-entity> on a 2-on-1 by one-timing a shot from the left hash marks. 
Kochetkov made several difficult saves. He stopped <forge-entity title="Bo Horvat" slug="bo-horvat-8477500" code="player">Bo Horvat</forge-entity> from in close at 9:56 of the first by moving across the slot to make a pad save, then later denied <forge-entity title="Brock Nelson" slug="brock-nelson-8475754" code="player">Brock Nelson</forge-entity> on the doorstep with the blocker on a 2-on-1 at 13:41 of the third period.

“You’re always tracking the puck and seeing where different guys are,” Kochetkov said. “Today I have saves. It’s good for me.”

For Carolina, the win follows a 4-1 victory against the Columbus Blue Jackets on Sunday, when <forge-entity title="Dustin Tokarski" slug="dustin-tokarski-8474682" code="player">Dustin Tokarski</forge-entity> made 27 saves in his Hurricanes debut.

“Overall, the last two games we have looked pretty good overall,” Aho said. “I think there’s another level. You’re never satisfied. If you have a great game, you still want to improve.

“The mindset has been not giving them anything. Both goalies played great games, but I think we’ve done \[a\] little bit better job to shut them down as well and wait for our own opportunities.”

**NOTES:** The Islanders have given up the first goal in each of their past eight games. … New York has been shut out five times this season … The Hurricanes are 9-2-1 against the Metropolitan Division. … Gostisbehere has seven multipoint games this season.

**St Louis Blues 1 - 4 New Jersey Devils**  
In their 4-1 victory over the St. Louis Blues, the New Jersey Devils secured their third straight win with Stefan Noesen scoring in his milestone 400th NHL game. Noesen's goal, a scrappy power-play effort, brought his season tally to 14, matching his career high from the previous year. Ondrej Palat, Brenden Dillon, and Jesper Bratt also contributed to the Devils’ scoring, with Dillon's goal coming from a deflected shot that boosted the lead in the third period. Jack Hughes provided two assists, continuing his impressive streak with 16 points over the past nine games. Although the Blues' Jordan Kyrou extended his goal streak to five games, it wasn’t enough to overcome the Devils’ dominance, especially after the Devils' disciplined play and efficient scoring. Jacob Markstrom, making 19 saves, remained unbeaten in regulation over his last seven starts. Notably, Devils forward Curtis Lazar marked his return after a long injury absence by winning 10 of 15 face-offs, adding depth to New Jersey's stellar team performance.

**Nashville Predators 2 - 0 New York Rangers**  
Saros makes 25 saves, Predators shut out Rangers
 **NASHVILLE --** <forge-entity title="Juuse Saros" slug="juuse-saros-8477424" code="player">Juuse Saros</forge-entity> made 25 saves for the Nashville Predators in a 2-0 win against the New York Rangers at Bridgestone Arena on Tuesday. 
<forge-entity title="Jonathan Marchessault" slug="jonathan-marchessault-8476539" code="player">Jonathan Marchessault</forge-entity> scored to extended his point streak to four games (three goals, three assists), and <forge-entity title="Adam Wilsby" slug="adam-wilsby-8482482" code="player">Adam Wilsby</forge-entity> got his first NHL goal for the Predators (9-17-6), who have won two of their past three games after losing eight straight (0-5-3). <forge-entity title="Steven Stamkos" slug="steven-stamkos-8474564" code="player">Steven Stamkos</forge-entity> and <forge-entity title="Filip Forsberg" slug="filip-forsberg-8476887" code="player">Filip Forsberg</forge-entity> each had two assists.

“Really proud of the group, how we handled the last five minutes,” Nashville coach Andrew Brunette said. “We didn’t give up a whole lot. We closed the game out. Our details were sharp, and that’s hard to do when things aren’t going your way this year. A lot of times you see a little fragility with your group. I thought today we looked like a team that’s won a lot of games how we closed it out.” 
The Rangers (15-15-1) have lost five of six and are 3-11-0 in their past 14 games. <forge-entity title="Igor Shesterkin" slug="igor-shesterkin-8478048" code="player">Igor Shesterkin</forge-entity> made 30 saves.

“What I didn’t like was the third period,” New York coach Peter Laviolette said. “We came out and I thought they had the edge on us. They probably 2-to-1’ed us in chances, seven to four, six to three, something like that. We needed more in the third when you’re down 1-0. That’s where we’ve got to find our way out of something, and that’s where we’re not getting it done right now.”

Marchessault gave the Predators a 1-0 lead at 13:37 of the first period. Forsberg got the puck to Stamkos, who made a backhand pass to Marchessault for a tap-in at the right post on the rush.

“Obviously I’m playing with gifted players, so the game gets a little easier sometimes out there,” Marchessault said. “But despite the production or not, I was just trying to help my team win a hockey game. Right now, I think we’ve been doing that so far. We’ve got to keep building. Obviously we’ve had a really bad start, but that’s in the past now.” 
Wilsby pushed it to 2-0 at 11:59 of the third period. He deked around Rangers forward <forge-entity title="Reilly Smith" slug="reilly-smith-8475191" code="player">Reilly Smith</forge-entity> at the blue line, skated down the slot, and beat Shesterkin with the wrist shot through traffic.

“Unbelievable first goal by Wilsby there,” Predators defenseman <forge-entity title="Luke Schenn" slug="luke-schenn-8474568" code="player">Luke Schenn</forge-entity> said. “I don’t even know how you could dream of having a better goal than that. That was pretty special, and pretty elite skating on the blue line there. He was dancing and picked the corner.”

It was the first time the Rangers have been shut out this season.

“We’ve got to find ways to score goals,” New York forward <forge-entity title="Chris Kreider" slug="chris-kreider-8475184" code="player">Chris Kreider</forge-entity> said. “They did a good job on the \[penalty\] kill. We got a few looks. They were obviously blocking a lot and getting in lanes, but we knew that going in so we needed to do more bad-angle shots. Stuff just thrown into the mud and jumping on the loose stuff. There were moments of it, and we did a better job of playing north, playing quickly and establishing some zone time.”

Rangers defenseman <forge-entity title="Urho Vaakanainen" slug="urho-vaakanainen-8480001" code="player">Urho Vaakanainen</forge-entity> made his team debut after being acquired in a trade with the Anaheim Ducks for former captain <forge-entity title="Jacob Trouba" slug="jacob-trouba-8476885" code="player">Jacob Trouba</forge-entity> on Dec. 8, while forward <forge-entity title="Artemi Panarin" slug="artemi-panarin-8478550" code="player">Artemi Panarin</forge-entity> missed his second consecutive game because of an upper-body injury.

**Chicago Blackhawks 3 - 2 Washington Capitals**  
In a thrilling showdown at the United Center, Ryan Donato's late goal at 17:42 of the third period secured a 3-2 comeback victory for the Chicago Blackhawks against the Washington Capitals. Despite trailing 2-0 after first-period goals from Pierre-Luc Dubois and Andrew Mangiapane, Chicago rallied with Ilya Mikheyev scoring their first short-handed goal of the season and TJ Brodie equalizing the score with a wrist shot. Arvid Soderblom also made a significant impact with 20 saves for Chicago. Teuvo Teravainen shone with three assists, marking his second straight three-point game. The Capitals, arriving late in Chicago due to travel issues, struggled to find their rhythm, which was noted by coach Spencer Carbery. This victory mirrored a recent comeback led by Connor Bedard, who marked his 100th NHL game during this match.

**Calgary Flames 3 - 4 Boston Bruins**  
In an exciting matchup at Scotiabank Saddledome, David Pastrnak scored with 38 seconds left in overtime, securing a 4-3 victory for the Boston Bruins over the Calgary Flames. The Bruins, overcoming a two-goal deficit in the third period, have now won six of their last eight games. Elias Lindholm, also playing against his former team for the first time since being traded, contributed a goal and an assist for the Bruins. Calgary briefly held a 2-0 lead after quick second-period goals by Matt Coronato and Nazem Kadri, and although Ryan Lomberg added another, it wasn't sufficient to halt the Flames' recent struggles, as they have now lost four of their last six matches. Bruins' Jeremy Swayman made 20 saves, while Flames' Dustin Wolf stopped 31 shots in a competitive game.
