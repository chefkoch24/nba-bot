**Indiana Pacers 116 - 120 Cleveland Cavaliers**  
In a thrilling matchup, the Cleveland Cavaliers narrowly defeated the Indiana Pacers 120-116, with Darius Garland inspiring a late rally by scoring 14 of his 29 points in the fourth quarter. Despite missing key players, including Donovan Mitchell and Max Strus, and losing Dean Wade during the game, the Cavs overcame a nine-point deficit entering the final quarter. Contributions from Evan Mobley (20 points), Jarrett Allen (19 points), and a strong showing from Sam Merrill, who hit six 3-pointers, were vital in securing the win. The beleaguered Pacers, now on a franchise-record 13-game losing streak, were led by Pascal Siakam and Jay Huff. Despite missing several key players due to injuries, Indiana kept the game competitive but failed to push it into overtime in the final moments. Coach Rick Carlisle's wait for his 1,000th career win continues, with the Pacers set to face Charlotte next.

**Washington Wizards 120 - 112 Orlando Magic**  
The Washington Wizards emerged victorious over the Orlando Magic with a 120-112 win, largely thanks to CJ McCollum's 27 points and his pivotal role in stabilizing the team after nearly squandering a massive lead. Washington initially gained command with a 26-point advantage, but their inexperience showed as Orlando aggressively reduced the gap to just two points. However, McCollum's late-game heroics, which included an alley-oop to Alex Sarr and crucial shots, helped secure the win. Sarr contributed 23 points, strengthening the Wizards' strong run, winning five of their last seven games despite their rebuilding phase following a poor start. The Magic, despite leading the Southeast Division and being sixth in the Eastern Conference, struggled without key players Franz Wagner and Jalen Suggs, with standout performances from reserves like Jase Richardson, who led Orlando with 20 points. The Wizards and Magic are set for more challenges as they both play away games on Wednesday against Philadelphia and Brooklyn, respectively.

In a thrilling finish, the Memphis Grizzlies narrowly defeated the San Antonio Spurs 106-105, with Cam Spencer playing a pivotal role by scoring 21 points, including a crucial 10-foot jumper with 36.5 seconds remaining.

Despite a stellar 30-point performance from Victor Wembanyama in his return for the Spurs, Memphis ended its four-game losing streak. The game saw a dramatic final sequence, with Santi Aldama's decisive block on De'Aaron Fox's shot securing Memphis's victory. The Grizzlies overcame a poor first half and erased San Antonio's 11-point lead with a strong third-quarter run. Memphis's next game is against Phoenix, while the Spurs will host the Lakers.

**Minnesota Timberwolves 122 - 94 Miami Heat**  
In a dominant second-half performance, the Minnesota Timberwolves triumphed over the Miami Heat 122-94, marking their second victory against Miami in four days. Despite being listed as questionable due to a foot injury, Anthony Edwards led Minnesota with 26 points, including a team-high five 3-pointers, though he faced foul trouble that limited his play. Minnesota bolstered their third consecutive win with strong contributions from Jaden McDaniels and Rudy Gobert, who secured a double-double with 13 points and 17 rebounds. Miami's Norman Powell scored 21 points, while Tyler Herro, returning from an 11-game absence, added 17 points off the bench. The Timberwolves expanded their seven-point halftime lead significantly in the second half, aided by Julius Randle’s crucial deep 3-pointer and Dante DiVincenzo’s impressive shots, before both teams cleared their benches with Minnesota commanding a 28-point lead.

**New Orleans Pelicans 103 - 111 Los Angeles Lakers**

Deandre Ayton contributed 18 points and 11 rebounds for the Lakers, who have now won four of their last five games, while the Pelicans suffered their eighth consecutive loss despite a career-high 41 points from Trey Murphy. New Orleans led by nine points late in the third quarter, but the Lakers began the fourth with an 18-4 run, including crucial contributions from James and Ayton, which proved decisive. The Pelicans struggled, missing five of 18 free throws and 30 of 40 three-point attempts. Both teams are back in action on Wednesday, with the Lakers facing the San Antonio Spurs and the Pelicans taking on the Atlanta Hawks.

**Sacramento Kings 76 - 75 Dallas Mavericks**  
The Dallas Mavericks aim to end a seven-game road losing streak as they face the Sacramento Kings, a team they lost to 113-107 on December 27. Dallas, with a poor 3-12 road record, recently snapped a four-game skid with a 110-104 home win over the Houston Rockets, led by Anthony Davis’s 26 points and 12 rebounds, and Max Christie’s efficient 24 points. As the team remains outside the playoff spots, rookie Cooper Flagg's recent decline in performance is worrying, though coach Jason Kidd remains optimistic. Despite his struggles, Flagg scored 23 points in their previous loss to Sacramento. The Kings, embroiled in their own struggles, have the third-worst NBA record and are in a five-game losing streak, including a significant defeat to the Milwaukee Bucks. Despite recent setbacks, Zach LaVine returned to contribute 20 points against Milwaukee, while Sacramento faces further challenges with injuries to Keegan Murray and briefly to Keon Ellis, highlighting the resilience both teams will need for their upcoming matchup.
