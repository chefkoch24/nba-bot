**Philadelphia 76ers 99 - 109 Phoenix Suns**  
In a notable shift, Bradley Beal came off the bench for the first time in nine years, leading the Phoenix Suns to a 109-99 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers, snapping a four-game losing streak. Beal's 25-point performance, including 20 points in the second half, was instrumental as the Suns overcame an early 12-point deficit. Kevin Durant added 23 points and Ryan Dunn contributed 15, helping Phoenix secure just their second win in nine games. The 76ers, missing the injured Joel Embiid, relied on Tyrese Maxey, who delivered 31 points and 10 assists, and Kelly Oubre, who scored 26 points, but it was not enough. With Embiid's absence for the 21st game this season, Philadelphia's struggles continue, as they fall to 7-14 without him. Phoenix coach Mike Budenholzer's decision to bring Beal and Jusuf Nurkic off the bench paid off, with the Suns' reserves outscoring Philadelphia's bench 54-7. The Suns also excelled from beyond the arc, hitting 46.7% of their three-point attempts, including three 3-pointers each from Durant, Beal, and Dunn.
