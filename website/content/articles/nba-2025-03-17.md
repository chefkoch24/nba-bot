**Dallas Mavericks 125 - 130 Philadelphia 76ers**  
In a thrilling clash of undermanned teams, the Philadelphia 76ers narrowly defeated the Dallas Mavericks 130-125, with Quentin Grimes shining against his former squad by scoring 28 points. The 76ers secured just their third victory in 18 games, bolstered by Jalen Hood-Schifino's 19-point contribution. Despite P.J. Washington Jr.'s impressive 29 points and 12 rebounds for Dallas, the Mavericks fell to a season-low three games below .500, hovering just above the West's final play-in spot. Notably absent were top players like Kyrie Irving and Anthony Davis for Dallas, and Joel Embiid, Paul George, and Tyrese Maxey for Philadelphia due to injuries. The game also highlighted a key moment when Grimes' free throws sealed the deal after a reviewed foul on Naji Marshall. Meanwhile, Andre Drummond paid homage to Dirk Nowitzki by donning a tee with Nowitzki's iconic one-legged fadeaway, adding a nostalgic touch to an intense matchup.

**Los Angeles Lakers 107 - 96 Phoenix Suns**  
In a battle at the Staples Center, the Los Angeles Lakers snapped a four-game losing streak by defeating the Phoenix Suns 107-96, extending their home winning streak to seven games. Despite the absence of LeBron James, sidelined with a left groin strain, and Rui Hachimura with a knee injury, the Lakers saw a stellar performance from Luka Doncic, who tallied 33 points, 11 rebounds, and eight assists. Austin Reaves added 28 points, while Jaxson Hayes matched his season high with 19.

Phoenix’s poor defensive display allowed the Lakers to capitalize, with a crucial 3-pointer from Dorian Finney-Smith sealing the victory. Despite the Suns trimming their deficit late in the game, their inability to close the gap kept them 1.5 games behind Dallas for the final play-in spot. Both teams will face quick turnarounds, as the Suns host the Raptors, and the Lakers prepare to face the Spurs.

The Cavs, unable to close out in the final moments, saw Donovan Mitchell miss three crucial shots in the last minute of play.

Despite shooting 6 of 22, Banchero contributed significantly with 11 rebounds and seven assists, while Wendell Carter Jr. added 16 points and 14 rebounds.
