**Houston Rockets 131 - 116 Golden State Warriors**  
The Houston Rockets kept their playoff hopes alive by delivering a standout performance in Game 5, beating the Golden State Warriors 131-116 to force a Game 6 in their first-round series. Fred VanVleet led the Rockets with 26 points, while Amen Thompson added 25, with all five Houston starters scoring in double figures. Warriors coach Steve Kerr conceded early, pulling his starters when Houston took a commanding lead 93-64 in the third quarter. A brief scare occurred when Golden State cut the deficit to 109-92, prompting Houston to reinsert their starters. A later 9-5 Warriors run brought them within 114-101 before a scuffle led to the ejection of Pat Spencer for headbutting Alperen Sengun. Ultimately, Houston eliminated any comeback hopes with a 7-2 run. Notably, the Warriors' bench contributed 76 points, a franchise playoff record. VanVleet, reminding his teammates of their consistent competitiveness, emphasized staying confident and poised. As the series heads back to San Francisco, the Rockets aim to become the 14th team in NBA history to overturn a 3-1 deficit in a best-of-seven series, a feat Houston achieved in the 2015 Western Conference semifinals and one the Warriors painfully remember from 2016.

**Los Angeles Lakers 96 - 103 Minnesota Timberwolves**  
In a thrilling Game 4, the Minnesota Timberwolves claimed a 3-1 lead in their first-round Western Conference playoff series by defeating the Los Angeles Lakers 116-113, despite trailing by 10 points early in the fourth quarter. Anthony Edwards was the standout performer, scoring 16 of his series-high 43 points in the final 12 minutes, including three crucial 3-pointers, helping Minnesota overturn a late deficit. This victory marks part of a significant turnaround for the Timberwolves, who have gone 20-5 since March 2 after adjusting to Julius Randle's arrival. In contrast, the Lakers, who initially found a promising synergy with newcomer Luka Doncic under new head coach JJ Redick, now face elimination unless they secure three consecutive wins. Although Doncic contributed 38 points and LeBron James added 27 points with 12 rebounds and eight assists in Game 4, the Lakers faltered with poor shooting in the fourth quarter, prompting James to emphasize the importance of focusing on Game 5 to keep their season alive.
