**Charlotte Hornets 107 - 123 Orlando Magic**  
The Orlando Magic secured a 123-107 victory against the Charlotte Hornets, ending their four-game losing streak. Franz Wagner led the Magic with 21 points despite being questionable due to a left heel contusion. Paolo Banchero was just shy of a triple-double with 18 points, nine rebounds, and nine assists. The Hornets' LaMelo Ball achieved his third double-double of the season with 17 points and 13 assists but was fined $35,000 for an obscene gesture made in a previous game. Charlotte, which started three rookies for the first time in team history, faced a tough defense that limited Kon Knueppel's three-point success. Orlando took an early lead, with Desmond Bane contributing significantly, and maintained their edge throughout, achieving their highest first-half points of the season. The Magic will next face the Washington Wizards, while the Hornets prepare to host the Minnesota Timberwolves.

**Milwaukee Bucks 120 - 110 Golden State Warriors**  
Ryan Rollins delivered a standout performance, achieving a career-high 32 points as the Milwaukee Bucks triumphed over the Golden State Warriors 120-110, despite the absence of Giannis Antetokounmpo due to knee soreness. Rollins, who previously played for the Warriors, was impressive, making 13 of 21 shots and five of seven from beyond the arc, and also contributed eight assists. Myles Turner and Cole Anthony supported with solid contributions, the latter leading a bench that outscored their Warriors counterparts. Despite Stephen Curryâ€™s 27-point effort and the end of his 57 free throw streak, Golden State fell short, failing to overcome an eight-point deficit late in the game. Rollins sealed the game with a decisive three-pointer, which was part of an 11-2 run that dismantled Golden State's comeback hopes.

**Oklahoma City Thunder 127 - 108 Washington Wizards**  
In a commanding display, the Oklahoma City Thunder extended their unbeaten streak to 6-0 with a 127-108 victory over the Washington Wizards. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the charge with 31 points, while reserve Ajay Mitchell contributed 20 points, maintaining a perfect free-throw record for the season. Isaiah Joe, returning from injury, added another 20 points with five key 3-pointers, helping the Thunder improve their previously dismal 3-point shooting percentage. Defensively, Oklahoma City excelled by forcing 22 turnovers while committing only six, with Cason Wallace and Alex Caruso making significant contributions in steals. Despite their on-court success, the Thunder face challenges, notably the announcement that guard Nikola Topic is undergoing chemotherapy for testicular cancer, and the continued absence of injured stars Chet Holmgren and Jalen Williams. The Thunder finished strong in both halves, pulling away with extended runs and securing their largest lead of 24 points in the fourth quarter.

Despite being shorthanded, Miami made a strong effort, led by Bam Adebayo's 31 points, 10 rebounds, and three assists, and even managed a 17-1 run at the start of the fourth quarter. The Spurs, however, maintained their edge with key contributions from Stephon Castle, who added 21 points, eight assists, and six rebounds, and Devin Vassell, who scored 17 points. The Spurs ultimately closed the game with an 8-3 run, preserving their win streak. The game concluded with Wembanyama rallying the crowd as the Spurs etched their name in the record books, leaving the Heat to regroup for their upcoming match against the Los Angeles Lakers.
