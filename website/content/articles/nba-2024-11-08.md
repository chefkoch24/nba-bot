**San Antonio Spurs 118 - 105 Portland Trail Blazers**  
The San Antonio Spurs secured a balanced 118-105 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers in a game played without their head coach Gregg Popovich, who was absent due to a medical issue. Keldon Johnson and Malaki Branham led the Spurs with 17 points each, while Zach Collins and Julian Champagnie contributed 14 points each. Malaki Branham left early in the fourth quarter due to an ankle injury, which added to the Spurs' depth concerns as they were already missing several key players. Despite their lineup challenges, the Spurs' reserves stepped up, with backups contributing a total of 58 points. The Trail Blazers' Deandre Ayton and Jerami Grant both scored 21 points, with Ayton also grabbing 10 rebounds. Portland struggled with their 3-point shooting, making only 9 of 32 attempts. As the Spurs aim to resolve their scoring consistency issues, the return of Devin Vassell, who missed games after foot surgery, is expected to bolster their offense. Meanwhile, the Trail Blazers are set to face Minnesota, and the Spurs will host Utah in their next matches.
