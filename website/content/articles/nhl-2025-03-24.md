Despite a strong performance from Bryan Rust, who scored twice for the Penguins, and Evgeni Malkin's contribution, Pittsburgh could not maintain their lead. Sidney Crosby, making history with his 20th multipoint game of the season, oversaw the Penguins as they fell six points behind the Montreal Canadiens in the wild card race despite outshooting the Panthers 16-4 in the opening period. Notably, Reinhart's power-play expertise shone through, as he continues to trail only Leon Draisaitl in power-play goals since 2020-21.
