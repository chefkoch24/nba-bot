**Detroit Pistons 93 - 94 New York Knicks**  
In a thrilling playoff game, the New York Knicks rallied to a stunning 94-93 victory over the Detroit Pistons, taking a commanding 3-1 lead in their first-round series. The game was decided in the final moments when Karl-Anthony Towns hit a critical 3-pointer with 46.6 seconds remaining, ultimately securing the win despite a controversial no-call on Tim Hardaway Jr.'s last-second attempt. This tightly contested matchup saw Jalen Brunson contribute significantly with 32 points and 11 assists, overcoming an 11-point fourth-quarter deficit. Detroit's Cade Cunningham shone with a playoff triple-double, joining Isiah Thomas as the only Pistons to achieve this feat in the postseason, but missed crucial shots in the closing minute. The Knicks survived a scare when Brunson briefly exited with a leg injury but returned to lead the comeback. As the series shifts to New York for Game 5, the Pistons face elimination, continuing their unfortunate streak of nine consecutive home playoff losses dating back to 2008, tying an NBA record.

**Milwaukee Bucks 103 - 129 Indiana Pacers**  
The Indiana Pacers dominated the Milwaukee Bucks with a 129-103 victory to take a commanding 3-1 lead in their Eastern Conference playoff series. Myles Turner led the Pacers with 23 points, and Indiana showcased a balanced scoring effort with eight players reaching double figures. The Pacers capitalized on the unfortunate loss of Milwaukee's Damian Lillard, who exited the game with a potential Achilles tendon injury early in the first quarter. Indiana maintained control throughout, shooting 60.2% from the field and distancing themselves with a double-digit lead by halftime. Meanwhile, Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo posted 28 points and 15 rebounds, but it wasn't enough as the Bucks continued their road playoff struggles, losing eight straight games, with five consecutive defeats occurring at Indiana. The game also saw its share of physicality, with multiple double technical fouls, highlighting the intensity and chippiness of this series. Indiana can potentially close out the series in Game 5, facing a Milwaukee team that has underperformed and might have to do without Lillard.

In a dramatic game, the Minnesota Timberwolves staged a comeback to secure a 116-113 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers, taking a 3-1 lead in their first-round playoff series. Jaden McDaniels played a crucial role by converting a three-point play and stealing the ball from LeBron James in the final minute. Anthony Edwards led the Timberwolves with 43 points, including pivotal free throws after drawing a foul on James with 10 seconds remaining. Despite the Lakers' strong start in the third quarter with a 14-0 run, the Timberwolves dominated the fourth quarter for the second consecutive game. Luka Doncic, recovering from an earlier stomach bug, scored 38 points but struggled in the fourth quarter, while LeBron James, despite achieving his 144th playoff double-double, was held scoreless in the final period. The Wolves' consistent late-game performance has been a hallmark of their playoff run, outscoring the Lakers significantly in the fourth quarters of the series.
