**Atlanta Hawks 124 - 112 New Orleans Pelicans**  
The Atlanta Hawks secured their fourth consecutive win by defeating the struggling New Orleans Pelicans 124-112. Trae Young recorded his 15th double-double of the season with 12 points and 15 assists, while De'Andre Hunter led Atlanta with 22 points off the bench, coinciding with his 27th birthday. The Pelicans, now with an overall record of 4-18, have lost nine straight games, hampered by injuries to key players Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram. Despite the loss, CJ McCollum led New Orleans with 29 points, narrowly missing his season high. Notably, Dejounte Murray, in his first return to Atlanta since his trade, received cheers and contributed seven points and 10 assists. The Hawks capitalized on their shooting rhythm in the second half, highlighted by Young and Hunter's crucial 3-pointers that expanded their lead. Atlanta's teamwork was evident as seven players scored in double figures, and they maintained a streak of 14 games with at least 25 assists, a franchise record. The Hawks will next face the Milwaukee Bucks, while the Pelicans prepare to host the Phoenix Suns.

**Boston Celtics 108 - 89 Miami Heat**  
In a decisive victory for the Boston Celtics, Jaylen Brown led the team with 29 points, complemented by Jayson Tatum's 18 points and 11 rebounds, as well as Payton Pritchard's impressive 25 points off the bench, guiding them to a 108-89 win over the Miami Heat. Derrick White also contributed with 19 points, as the Celtics secured their eighth win in nine games. Despite Miami's early lead, they struggled without Jimmy Butler, who was out with a knee injury, and shot poorly from the field at 36% and just 23% from beyond the arc. Miami's Jaime Jaquez Jr. and Tyler Herro each scored 19 points, although Herro struggled from the three-point line. Notably, Pritchard, who achieved his fourth consecutive 20+ points game off the bench—a feat last accomplished by a Celtic in 2015 by Isaiah Thomas, added excitement by beating the third-quarter buzzer with an impressive left-handed layup, increasing Boston's lead to 22 points. Both teams will return to their home courts on Wednesday night, with Boston hosting Detroit and Miami facing the Lakers.

**Chicago Bulls 128 - 102 Brooklyn Nets**  
The Chicago Bulls dominated the Brooklyn Nets with a 128-102 victory, highlighting a strong performance from Josh Giddey, who achieved his first triple-double of the season and the 12th of his career with 20 points, 13 rebounds, and 11 assists. Nikola Vucevic added 21 points and 10 rebounds for a resurgent Bulls team that had previously lost three out of four games. Chicago also saw contributions from Matas Buzelis and Zach LaVine with 20 and 18 points, respectively. Meanwhile, the Nets, dealing with multiple injuries including the absence of Cam Johnson, suffered their third straight defeat. Despite 18 points from Dariq Whitehead and a double-double from Dennis Schroder, Brooklyn struggled offensively, shooting just 40% from the field. The Bulls' superior 52.2% shooting, a 13-0 run in the first half, and a strong third quarter where they outscored the Nets 36-22 paved the way for their commanding win. Additionally, the Bulls' streak of shooting at least 50% continues, marking the longest active run in the NBA this season.

**Minnesota Timberwolves 109 - 80 Los Angeles Lakers**  
The Minnesota Timberwolves delivered a dominant 109-80 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers, marking the Lakers' lowest point total since a 2017 loss to Dallas. Julius Randle and Rudy Gobert spearheaded the Timberwolves with 18 and 17 points respectively, while Gobert also added 12 rebounds. Despite an off night for Anthony Edwards, Minnesota excelled in defense, allowing fewer than 100 points for the second consecutive game. The Lakers, struggling with consistency, saw underwhelming performances from LeBron James and Anthony Davis, who were both limited to quiet scoring nights. D’Angelo Russell made a significant impact in his return to the Timberwolves lineup with 20 points. Minnesota successfully revitalized their transition game and three-point shooting, landing 15 of 35 shots from beyond the arc and scoring 20 fast-break points. The Lakers' rookie coach J.J. Redick labeled his team's performance as "uneven and inconsistent" after their fifth loss in seven games.
