**Detroit Red Wings 7 - 3 Buffalo Sabres**  
Patrick Kane delivered a standout performance with two goals and three assists, leading the Detroit Red Wings to a 7-3 victory over the Buffalo Sabres and ending their six-game losing streak. The game was marked by Detroit's three power-play goals and 150 penalty minutes between the teams, including 136 in the third period. Kane's five-point game was his fourth career achievement of this magnitude, tying him for sixth among U.S.-born players. Despite Buffalo taking an early lead through Tage Thompson, who continued his strong record against Detroit, contributions from Alex DeBrincat, Marco Kasper, and others ensured a decisive win for the Red Wings. Petr Mrazek, acquired from Chicago, secured his first win for Detroit since 2018, making 23 saves. The Sabres, struggling with losses in seven of their last eight games, saw brief successes from players like Zach Benson, although defensive breakdowns proved costly.
