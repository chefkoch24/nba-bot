Immanuel Quickley led the Toronto Raptors to a 111-106 victory over the Charlotte Hornets with 22 points and 11 assists, helping the team overcome the absence of injured All-Star Scottie Barnes. The win marked the Raptors' seventh consecutive home victory over the Hornets, with RJ Barrett contributing 23 points and Gary Trent Jr. adding 17 points. Brandon Miller led Charlotte with 26 points and 10 rebounds, but it wasn't enough to prevent the Hornets from losing their fourth straight game.

In a thrilling matchup, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 35 points to lead the Oklahoma City Thunder to a 118-110 victory over the Phoenix Suns, propelling them back to the top spot in the Western Conference.

Josh Hart recorded a triple-double, Donte DiVincenzo scored 28 points, and Miles McBride stepped up in Brunson's absence with 16 points.
