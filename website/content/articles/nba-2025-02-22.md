**Cleveland Cavaliers 142 - 105 New York Knicks**  
In a dominant performance, the Cleveland Cavaliers overpowered the New York Knicks with a 142-105 victory, showcasing their elite status in the Eastern Conference. Donovan Mitchell shined with 27 points, while Evan Mobley contributed 21 as the Cavaliers extended their winning streak to six games and maintained the NBA's best record at 46-10, with 34 of those wins by double digits. Despite a valiant 26-point effort from Jalen Brunson and 23 points from Karl-Anthony Towns, the Knicks suffered their worst defeat of the season. All-Star Darius Garland gave the Cavs a scare when he hit his head on the floor, but continued to play, while Jarrett Allen left the game with a hand injury, with X-rays showing no fracture. Cleveland also benefited from the return of Dean Wade, adding depth to their defense. Mitchell's impressive first-half performance, including three rapid 3-pointers, helped establish a substantial 27-point lead at halftime. Both teams face challenging games ahead, with the Knicks visiting Boston and the Cavaliers hosting the high-scoring Memphis Grizzlies.

**Houston Rockets 121 - 115 Minnesota Timberwolves**  
In a closely contested game, the Houston Rockets narrowly defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves, with the latter dealing with significant injury concerns affecting key players. Anthony Edwards, the Timberwolves’ star averaging 27.5 points per game, was questionable for the matchup due to hip soreness, adding to a long list of Minnesota's injury woes, including Rudy Gobert and Mike Conley. Despite their short-handed roster, the Timberwolves entered the All-Star break with a morale-boosting victory over Oklahoma City, largely thanks to Naz Reid's impressive performance. Meanwhile, the Rockets, who had been struggling with a string of losses, particularly felt the absence of Fred VanVleet, their floor leader sidelined with an ankle injury. Aaron Holiday filled in admirably, matching his career-high with 25 points. Despite their recent struggles, the Rockets' Jalen Green and center Alperen Sengun have been standout performers this season. The Timberwolves have dominated recent matchups against the Rockets, but this game demonstrated both teams' resilience in facing adversity.
