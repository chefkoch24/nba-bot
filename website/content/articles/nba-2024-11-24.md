**Utah Jazz 121 - 106 New York Knicks**  
Lauri Markkanen's impressive 34-point performance led the Utah Jazz to a 121-106 victory over the New York Knicks, ending the Jazz's four-game losing streak. Collin Sexton contributed significantly, hitting four crucial three-pointers in the fourth quarter and finishing with 25 points, while John Collins added a double-double with 20 points and 13 rebounds. Despite OG Anunoby's season-high 27 points and a strong 16-point, 16-rebound effort from Karl-Anthony Towns, the Knicks' poor 39% shooting from the field and defensive struggles were evident, snapping their four-game winning streak. The Jazz capitalized on the Knicks' late-game defensive lapses, with a pivotal 10-point run late in the fourth quarter. Key plays from Walker Kessler and others gave Utah a solid halftime lead, and despite New York's attempts to rally, the Jazz held firm to secure the win.

**Orlando Magic 111 - 100 Detroit Pistons**  
Franz Wagner led the Orlando Magic to a 111-100 victory over the Detroit Pistons with an impressive performance, tallying 30 points, nine rebounds, and eight assists, marking his fifth game of 30 or more points in his last seven outings. The Magic claimed their eighth win in nine games and remained undefeated at home, even without key players Paolo Banchero and Wendell Carter Jr., and after losing Jalen Suggs to injury. Despite these absences, Orlando's bench stepped up, with Mo Wagner contributing 18 points and Jonathan Isaac securing 12 rebounds along with three blocks. The Pistons, missing their leading scorer Cade Cunningham due to injury, struggled to compensate, committing 17 turnovers that led to 29 points for the Magic. Jaden Ivey's 19 points and Malik Beasley's 18 points weren't enough to counteract Orlando's strong run in the second half, which was catalyzed by a 20-9 surge including nine straight points from Franz Wagner. The Pistons will next face the Toronto Raptors, while Orlando is set to take on Charlotte.

**Chicago Bulls 131 - 142 Memphis Grizzlies**  
Scotty Pippen Jr. delivered an outstanding performance with a career-high 30 points and 10 assists, leading the Memphis Grizzlies to a 142-131 victory over the Chicago Bulls. Playing in the city where his father's legendary legacy looms, Pippen Jr. had already amassed 26 points by the end of the third quarter. Jaylen Wells contributed significantly with 26 points, helping Memphis secure its second consecutive win and third in four games. Meanwhile, despite Zach LaVine's impressive effort, scoring 29 points with 26 in the second half, and Nikola Vucevic's 26 points and eight rebounds, the Bulls couldn’t overcome the Grizzlies. Memphis maintained control throughout, with crucial contributions from Jaren Jackson Jr. and Santi Aldama and a strong rebounding edge, leading 64-60 at halftime and outrebounding the Bulls 49-35. Even during Ja Morant’s absence, Memphis improved their record to 5-3, while the Bulls struggled despite efficient three-point shooting, ultimately undercut by poor overall shooting and an inability to sustain momentum.

The game was marked by a heated exchange between Sharpe and Houston's Dillon Brooks, resulting in technical fouls. Despite a late surge from Alperen Sengun, who scored 22 points for the Rockets, Portland held firm, showing resilience after a previous loss, and broke their two-game losing streak. The Blazers capitalized on their long-range shooting, sinking 18 out of 44 three-pointers, while the Rockets struggled with their shots, converting only 8 of 32.

In a thrilling game, the Milwaukee Bucks overcame a career-high 50-point performance by LaMelo Ball to defeat the Charlotte Hornets 125-119, marking their fourth consecutive victory. Giannis Antetokounmpo contributed 32 points and 11 rebounds, while Damian Lillard added 31 points for the Bucks, who cemented their win with key free throws from Taurean Prince and Antetokounmpo in the final seconds. Despite Ball's scoring explosion and Brandon Miller's 32 points, the Hornets could not overcome the Bucks' late 14-5 surge and sharp 3-point shooting, with Milwaukee hitting 18 of 37 from beyond the arc. The Bucks successfully completed a 4-0 homestand and have won six of their last seven games, avenging a prior controversial loss to Charlotte. Meanwhile, Charlotte has struggled, losing five of their last seven, and also saw Grant Williams leave the game with a leg injury.

**San Antonio Spurs 104 - 94 Golden State Warriors**  
Victor Wembanyama's return proved pivotal as the San Antonio Spurs rallied from a 17-point third-quarter deficit to defeat the Golden State Warriors 104-94.

Spurs rookie Stephon Castle added 19 points and made a crucial steal from Stephen Curry to help maintain their late lead. The Warriors, who had a two-game winning streak, faltered offensively, with Andrew Wiggins scoring 20 points and Curry adding 14. Notably, Golden State's bench, which normally averaged 54 points, was limited to 36. The Spurs ultimately overcame the Warriors by outscoring them 33-13 in the fourth quarter, with Castle and Wembanyama leading the charge.

**Los Angeles Lakers 102 - 127 Denver Nuggets**  
The Los Angeles Lakers are set to host the Denver Nuggets in a repeat of their first-round playoff clash from last season, where the Nuggets secured a 4-1 series win before being ousted by the Timberwolves. The Lakers are looking to rebound from a narrow 119-118 defeat to the Orlando Magic, in which poor free-throw shooting in the closing moments, particularly from Anthony Davis and LeBron James, cost them the game. Despite Davis scoring 39 points and James adding 31 points with 10 rebounds and seven assists, the Lakers dropped their first home game in eight and ended a six-game winning streak. Meanwhile, the Nuggets will be playing back-to-back games following a 123-120 loss to the Dallas Mavericks, but received a boost with Nikola Jokic returning after welcoming his child, recording a triple-double with 33 points, 17 rebounds, and 10 assists. Jokic, averaging 30 points, 14 rebounds, and 11.5 assists while shooting 58.5% from three-point range, remains a dominant force. The Nuggets, however, have lost three of their last four games but remain successful on the second night of back-to-backs this season.
