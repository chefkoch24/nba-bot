**New Jersey Devils 5 - 0 New York Rangers**  
Jack Hughes, Markstrom help Devils shut out Rangers
 **NEWARK, N.J. --** <forge-entity title="Jack Hughes" slug="jack-hughes-8481559" code="player">Jack Hughes</forge-entity> had two goals and an assist, and the New Jersey Devils defeated the New York Rangers 5-0 at Prudential Center on Monday. 
<forge-entity title="Jacob Markstrom" slug="jacob-markstrom-8474593" code="player">Jacob Markstrom</forge-entity> made 12 saves for his second straight shutout and third of the season to extend his point streak to nine games (8-0-1). It was the Devils' first regular-season shutout against the Rangers since <forge-entity title="Cory Schneider" slug="cory-schneider-8471239" code="player">Cory Schneider</forge-entity> made 22 saves in a 4-0 victory Oct. 19, 2013.

"Winning cures everything and, every year, we've had a great group in the locker room," Hughes said. "Last year, we had fun but weren't winning. This year we're winning and that makes it more enjoyable. We go to work when it's time to go to work." 
<forge-entity title="Timo Meier" slug="timo-meier-8478414" code="player">Timo Meier</forge-entity> and <forge-entity title="Dawson Mercer" slug="dawson-mercer-8482110" code="player">Dawson Mercer</forge-entity> each had a goal and an assist, and <forge-entity title="Jesper Bratt" slug="jesper-bratt-8479407" code="player">Jesper Bratt</forge-entity> and <forge-entity title="Luke Hughes" slug="luke-hughes-8482684" code="player">Luke Hughes</forge-entity> each had two assists for the Devils (23-11-3), who are 5-1-0 in their past six games.

"It's good ... we're having fun and we're playing hard," Markstrom said. "You know, it's so much easier to work harder and do stuff in practice, and in the gym, if you're winning hockey games and that's what we're doing right now."

Jack Hughes has 26 points (15 goals, 11 assists) in 22 games against the Rangers, the most among all skaters since he entered the NHL in 2019-20.

"I've had a couple good games against these guys, but it's a great rivalry and whether we're here or at Madison Square Garden, we always get up for these games," Hughes said. "Heading into Christmas break, we wanted to make a statement and have a great game. They came out and wanted to start fast and we matched that energy early."

<forge-entity title="Jonathan Quick" slug="jonathan-quick-8471734" code="player">Jonathan Quick</forge-entity> made 24 saves for the Rangers (16-17-1), who are 4-13-0 in their past 17 games. New York is 0-2-0 while being outscored 10-1 against New Jersey this season.

"I thought in the second period, from a 5-on-5 standpoint, we held them in check but didn't generate enough ourselves," Rangers coach Peter Laviolette said. "So, defensively, the last couple games, it's tightened up from a 5-on-5 standpoint, but we're not getting enough looks at what we need in order to be successful offensively."

<forge-entity title="Chris Kreider" slug="chris-kreider-8475184" code="player">Chris Kreider</forge-entity> was a healthy scratch for New York and replaced by <forge-entity title="Jonny Brodzinski" slug="jonny-brodzinski-8477380" code="player">Jonny Brodzinski</forge-entity>.

"It was just a lineup decision ... we needed more," Laviolette said.

The Devils went 3-for-4 on the power play. The Rangers were 0-for-4 with three shots on goal with the man-advantage.

Hughes gave the Devils a 1-0 lead at 4:29 of the first period on a wrist shot from the left face-off circle. 
Meier pushed it to 2-0 with a power-play goal at 4:41 of the second. He scored on a snap shot from the right circle after getting a backhand pass from Dawson Mercer from the opposite side.

Hughes made it 3-0 at 11:13 of the second with another power-play goal. After taking a pass from <forge-entity title="Luke Hughes" slug="luke-hughes-8482684" code="player">Luke Hughes</forge-entity>, Jack skated low in the left circle and snapped a shot inside the left post.

"We wanted to get to our game and try to roll them over," Jack Hughes said. "We got the first one but we're just trying to play the same way. Some teams, when they get up a little bit, they park it a bit, but we stay aggressive and keep skating and keep packing it on."

<forge-entity title="Stefan Noesen" slug="stefan-noesen-8476474" code="player">Stefan Noesen</forge-entity> finished a tic-tac-toe passing play at 8:00 of the third for a 4-0 lead. Meier turned low in the right circle and passed to <forge-entity title="Nico Hischier" slug="nico-hischier-8480002" code="player">Nico Hischier</forge-entity>, who one-touched to Noesen at the left post.

Mercer scored a power-play goal at 12:35 of the third on a waist high deflection from the slot for the 5-0 final."I feel like we have extra weight on us, and everyone is trying too hard," Rangers forward <forge-entity title="Artemi Panarin" slug="artemi-panarin-8478550" code="player">Artemi Panarin</forge-entity> said. "I don't know. We're just not relaxed enough because I can promise, everyone on the team wants to win. Everyone works hard but sometimes if you have no confidence, you're not in a right place."

**NOTES:** Markstrom had his second straight shutout (12 saves in a 3-0 win against the Pittsburgh Penguins on Saturday), the second time he has done so in his NHL career. He is the second Devils goalie with consecutive shutouts in his first season with the team, following <forge-entity title="Mackenzie Blackwood" slug="mackenzie-blackwood-8478406" code="player">Mackenzie Blackwood</forge-entity> in 2018-19. ... Bratt's two assists gave him 31 assists in 37 games this season, the sixth-fewest games to 30 assists by a Devils/Colorado Rockies/Kansas City Scouts player in a season.

**Toronto Maple Leafs 2 - 5 Winnipeg Jets**  
Mark Scheifele's hat trick and four-point performance led the Winnipeg Jets to a 5-2 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs, breaking a six-game losing streak against them. Kyle Connor contributed significantly with two goals and two assists, while goaltender Connor Hellebuyck made 23 crucial saves for the Jets, who are now 5-1-1 in their last seven games. Despite being without their captain Auston Matthews due to injury, John Tavares managed to score twice for the Maple Leafs, marking his 200th goal with the team, a feat accomplished by only five players in NHL history with two different teams. The game highlighted the effectiveness of the Jets' first line, with Scheifele, Connor, and Gabriel Vilardi combining for 11 points in total, making Winnipeg the first NHL team this season to have two players with 20 goals each. Defenseman Haydn Fleury left the game with an injury, and the Leafs were also missing defenseman Chris Tanev due to a lower-body problem.

**Boston Bruins 4 - 1 Washington Capitals**  
Elias Lindholm scored a crucial go-ahead goal in the third period, helping the Boston Bruins secure a 4-1 victory over the Washington Capitals at TD Garden. Brad Marchand played a pivotal role with a goal and two assists, extending his impressive point streak to 10 games, making him the oldest player in Bruins history to achieve such a streak. Charlie Coyle also contributed a goal and an assist, while Jeremy Swayman made 10 saves for the Bruins, who improved their record to 4-0-1 in their last five games. Despite a power-play goal from Jakub Vrana, the Capitals struggled offensively, managing only 11 shots on goal, the fewest they've been limited to by Boston since 1993. The game was notable for a controversial hit by Oliver Wahlstrom that led to a game misconduct. Despite not having a perfect game, the Bruins demonstrated resilience, particularly in a third period where they have struggled historically, to clinch the win against a strong Capitals team.

**Detroit Red Wings 0 - 4 St Louis Blues**  
Holloway scores 1st NHL hat trick, Blues shut out Red Wings
 **DETROIT --** <forge-entity title="Dylan Holloway" slug="dylan-holloway-8482077" code="player">Dylan Holloway</forge-entity> scored his first NHL hat trick, and the St. Louis Blues defeated the Detroit Red Wings 4-0 at Little Caesars Arena on Monday. 
“That’s every kid’s dream -- scoring three goals in an NHL game,” Holloway said before posing for the traditional three-puck picture. “It feels pretty good, but I obviously couldn’t have done it without my teammates setting me up.”

<forge-entity title="Jordan Binnington" slug="jordan-binnington-8476412" code="player">Jordan Binnington</forge-entity> made 19 saves for his second shutout of the season and 17th in the NHL.

“I thought we were very strong defensively from start to finish, and we had a lot of chances offensively,” Binnington said. “It was a very complete game and it showed our commitment to playing for each other.” 
<forge-entity title="Alexandre Texier" slug="alexandre-texier-8480074" code="player">Alexandre Texier</forge-entity> also scored for St. Louis (16-16-4), which had lost three straight and five of six. <forge-entity title="Colton Parayko" slug="colton-parayko-8476892" code="player">Colton Parayko</forge-entity> and <forge-entity title="Robert Thomas" slug="robert-thomas-8480023" code="player">Robert Thomas</forge-entity> each had two assists.

“That was 60 minutes with high compete and playing the right way,” Blues coach Jim Montgomery said. “I think we were connected in all three zones and we played really fast tonight.”

<forge-entity title="Cam Talbot" slug="cam-talbot-8475660" code="player">Cam Talbot</forge-entity> made 17 saves for the Red Wings (13-17-4), who have lost three in a row.

“We had some push at times, but we just can’t get any rhythm,” Detroit coach Derek Lalonde said. “We would get a good shift from one line and then we would lose the next shift. We have to start piling onto the good shifts.”

The Red Wings have been outscored 13-4 during the three-game losing streak.

“We’re just not getting anything going,” Detroit captain <forge-entity title="Dylan Larkin" slug="dylan-larkin-8477946" code="player">Dylan Larkin</forge-entity> said. “We’re not even drawing penalties by driving to the net. I think nine or 10 shots -- whatever it was at the end of the second period -- was unacceptable.” 
Holloway gave the Blues a 1-0 lead at 16:14 with a slap shot over Talbot’s glove.

“I didn’t see anyone at the net, but I thought I could slide it over to Holly,” said Blues defenseman <forge-entity title="Cam Fowler" slug="cam-fowler-8475764" code="player">Cam Fowler</forge-entity>, who set up the goal. “He made a great shot - that was a good way to get started.”

Texier, newly promoted to the first line, made it 2-0 just 18 seconds into the second period after beating Talbot with a wrist shot from the right face-off dot.

“He has really blossomed here,” Montgomery said. “His confidence is high and I think he’s playing more direct and more north-south.”

Holloway scored his second goal of the game at 7:45 to extend it to 3-0, one-timing <forge-entity title="Brayden Schenn" slug="brayden-schenn-8475170" code="player">Brayden Schenn</forge-entity>’s pass.

Holloway completed the hat trick at 15:54 of the third period with an empty-net goal for the 4-0 final.

Detroit’s top defenseman, <forge-entity title="Moritz Seider" slug="moritz-seider-8481542" code="player">Moritz Seider</forge-entity>, was paired with <forge-entity title="Justin Holl" slug="justin-holl-8475718" code="player">Justin Holl</forge-entity> \-\- another right-handed shot -- with lefties <forge-entity title="Simon Edvinsson" slug="simon-edvinsson-8482762" code="player">Simon Edvinsson</forge-entity> and <forge-entity title="Ben Chiarot" slug="ben-chiarot-8475279" code="player">Ben Chiarot</forge-entity> both out with upper-body injuries. Holl was minus-2 in 21:23 and Seider was minus-3 in 22:59.

“Obviously, when any team loses its top two left-shot defensemen, it is going to look like that,” Lalonde said. “I thought our defensemen elevated -- our young guys who aren’t even everyday NHL players -- and we held that team to 21 shots.”

**NOTES:** Holloway’s hat trick was the first by a Blues skater this season. … Binnington surpassed <forge-entity title="Glenn Hall" slug="glenn-hall-8449988" code="player">Glenn Hall</forge-entity> for the fourth-most shutouts in Blues history. … Texier scored his 36th career goal and is one away from tying <forge-entity title="Sebastien Bordeleau" slug="sebastien-bordeleau-8459494" code="player">Sebastien Bordeleau</forge-entity> (37) for the third most by a player of French nationality in NHL history.

**Florida Panthers 0 - 4 Tampa Bay Lightning**  
Johansson makes 36 saves, Lightning shut out Panthers
 **SUNRISE, Fla.** \-\- <forge-entity title="Jonas Johansson" slug="jonas-johansson-8477992" code="player">Jonas Johansson</forge-entity> made 36 saves to help the Tampa Bay Lightning end the Florida Panthers’ four-game winning streak with a 4-0 win at Amerant Bank Arena on Monday. 
It was the fourth shutout in the NHL and third in two seasons with Tampa Bay for Johansson, who has won three straight starts.

“I feel confident, comfortable, and the team has been really solid in front of me which makes my life a whole lot easier,” Johansson said. “It was a really good team effort.” 
<forge-entity title="Nikita Kucherov" slug="nikita-kucherov-8476453" code="player">Nikita Kucherov</forge-entity>, <forge-entity title="Jake Guentzel" slug="jake-guentzel-8477404" code="player">Jake Guentzel</forge-entity>, and <forge-entity title="Mitchell Chaffee" slug="mitchell-chaffee-8482070" code="player">Mitchell Chaffee</forge-entity> scored in the first period for the Lightning (19-11-2). <forge-entity title="Brandon Hagel" slug="brandon-hagel-8479542" code="player">Brandon Hagel</forge-entity> had a goal and an assist, and <forge-entity title="Anthony Cirelli" slug="anthony-cirelli-8478519" code="player">Anthony Cirelli</forge-entity> and <forge-entity title="Victor Hedman" slug="victor-hedman-8475167" code="player">Victor Hedman</forge-entity> each had two assists.

“These are two teams who have battled it out, and when you include playoffs, regular season, and preseason, we have probably played this team more than double of any other,” Tampa Bay coach Jon Cooper said.

“These are two cross-state rivals, the last five Stanley Cups have had these two teams in them. Anytime you get together, it is pretty entertaining. This was another one tonight. They are always different, but the teams compete really hard.’’

<forge-entity title="Sergei Bobrovsky" slug="sergei-bobrovsky-8475683" code="player">Sergei Bobrovsky</forge-entity> made 25 saves for the Panthers (21-12-2), who ended the Lightning’s four-game winning streak on Sunday with a 4-2 win at Tampa Bay.

Florida had not lost a regulation game at home since Nov. 25 against the Washington Capitals.

“I think the offensive part of our game was there … their guy made some saves, we missed some nets,” Florida coach Paul Maurice said. “I don’t think we had a whole lot in the tank, but they did not lay over in that game. There was a pretty good spark there. We’ll leave it where it is. The four days \[off\] will be great for this team. It was our third home game this month. We’ve done a little traveling here, and I think it showed.’’

Kucherov gave the Lightning a 1-0 lead when he beat Bobrovsky glove-high with a backhand shot at 6:56 of the first period. 
Guentzel made it 2-0 at 9:20, one-timing a drop pass from Hagel from the high slot.

Chaffee scored on the power play when he pulled a rebound from his skate off a point shot from Cirelli at 16:24 for a 3-0 Lightning lead.

Hagel scored into an empty net to make it 4-0 with 5:42 remaining in the third period, Florida pulling Bobrovsky on a power-play chance.

“We just stuck to our game. \[Sunday\], our 5-on-5 was not the problem, but we had a few hiccups on the power play and, when you play this many games, it happens,” Hagel said. “We knew we did the right things and came here knowing we just needed to improve on some things.” 
The Panthers got a scare late in the first period when Matthew Tkachuk left under the help of defenseman Nate Schmidt and a team athletic trainer after colliding with Kucherov at full speed.

Kucherov was given a five-minute major for kneeing and a game misconduct.

Tkachuk returned to a loud ovation at 2:19 of the second period.

“That is who he is. He is incredible and is not going down easily,” Florida captain Aleksander Barkov said of Tkachuk. “You can count on that he is going to come back, no matter what. He is a true warrior. He battles through a lot of things.”

**NOTE:** Kucherov hit the 50-point mark with his first-period goal, matching his own franchise mark for fewest games to hit 50 points in a season (also 30 games, last season).

**Pittsburgh Penguins 7 - 3 Philadelphia Flyers**  
In a high-scoring clash, the Pittsburgh Penguins defeated the Philadelphia Flyers 7-3, with Sidney Crosby tying Mario Lemieux's franchise record of 1,033 career assists in the NHL. Crosby, also the game’s standout with a goal and three assists, played his 1,308th game, compared to Lemieux's 915.

Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan cited the importance of attitude and effort in overcoming challenges, while Philadelphia coach John Tortorella remained focused on improvement.

**Columbus Blue Jackets 5 - 4 Montreal Canadiens**  
In an exciting game, Kirill Marchenko scored a decisive late-third period goal to help the Columbus Blue Jackets secure a 5-4 victory over the Montreal Canadiens, marking his 13th goal and third point of the night. Marchenko was pivotal alongside linemates Dmitri Voronkov, who scored twice, and Sean Monahan, with each tallying multiple points. Despite the Canadiens' rally, including a two-point performance from both David Savard and Jake Evans, their three-game win streak was halted. Notably, Patrik Laine exited after the first period following big hits in his first game back in Columbus since being traded. The match also saw Denton Mateychuk make his NHL debut for the Blue Jackets. Marchenko extended his career-best six-game point streak, while Zach Werenski set a franchise record with points in 11 straight home games.

**New York Islanders 1 - 7 Buffalo Sabres**  
The Buffalo Sabres ended a 13-game losing streak with a dominant 7-1 victory over the New York Islanders at UBS Arena, as Jiri Kulich led the charge with two goals and an assist, marking his first multi-point NHL game. The Sabres' offensive onslaught included goals from Beck Malenstyn, Jason Zucker, Zach Benson, Jack Quinn, and Tage Thompson, with Rasmus Dahlin contributing four assists. Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen made 27 saves, allowing only one goal from Kyle Palmieri, who ended his three-game goalless streak for the Islanders. Notably, Islanders' goaltender Ilya Sorokin was penalized for the first time in his NHL career, and coach Patrick Roy's attempt to pull the goalie early in the third proved ineffective. Despite some noteworthy saves, the Islanders struggled defensively, continuing their challenge with power-play goals allowed on home ice, resulting in their first seven-goal concession since late 2023.

Juuse Saros bolstered the Predators’ efforts with 25 saves, helping secure Nashville's fourth win in six games. For the Hurricanes, Jordan Staal and Sebastian Aho managed to score, although a sluggish start put them at a disadvantage. Despite a spirited third period, Carolina fell short, with Coach Rod Brind’Amour expressing disappointment in their inability to find their rhythm earlier. The match also marked the Nashville debut of Justin Barron and was marred by a facial injury to Michael McCarron after being hit by a puck.

In a thrilling game at the Xcel Energy Center, the Minnesota Wild snapped a four-game losing streak with a narrow 4-3 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks. Brock Faber's crucial go-ahead goal early in the third period gave Minnesota a 3-2 lead, cementing his impact after a previously disallowed goal due to goaltender interference. Kirill Kaprizov and Jared Spurgeon also contributed goals for the Wild, with Filip Gustavsson making a triumphant return from injury by stopping 28 shots. Notably, Kaprizov set a new franchise record by reaching 50 points in just 34 games, surpassing his own previous record. Meanwhile, Connor Bedard maintained an impressive rookie year for the Blackhawks, matching Patrick Kane's mark for the third-most points by a teenager in a calendar year, with support from Nick Foligno's scoring effort. Despite a late push from Chicago, which brought the game within one with 33 seconds left, Minnesota held on to the victory thanks to Marcus Foligno's empty-net tally.

Despite efforts from San Jose's Mario Ferraro, who registered three assists, and Mackenzie Blackwood, who made 19 saves, the Sharks suffered their fifth consecutive loss. Notably, Hughes' performance tied Alexander Edler for the most multi-point games by a defenseman in Canucks' history, while the third line of Teddy Blueger, Dakota Joshua, and Conor Garland has been prolific, amassing 28 points in their last 10 games. The Canucks welcomed a holiday break with optimism, as highlighted by Joshua, who emphasized the team's focus on maintaining their momentum after the break.
