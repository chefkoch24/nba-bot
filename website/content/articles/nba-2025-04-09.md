**Charlotte Hornets 100 - 124 Memphis Grizzlies**  
The Memphis Grizzlies secured a decisive 124-100 victory over the Charlotte Hornets, with Ja Morant contributing 28 points, five rebounds, and eight assists. The game, however, was overshadowed by a concerning incident involving Memphis guard Jaylen Wells, who suffered a broken right wrist in a midair collision with Charlotte's K.J. Simpson during a fast-break dunk, leading to Wells being stretchered off the court. Simpson was ejected for a Flagrant 2 foul. Desmond Bane added 19 points, while Zach Edey recorded a double-double with 17 points and 19 rebounds for the Grizzlies. Despite efforts from Charlotte's LaMelo Ball and Miles Bridges, who scored 14 points each, the Hornets remained winless throughout the game. Notably, veteran Taj Gibson played his 999th career game. Morant's performance was especially celebrated due to his South Carolina roots, drawing significant cheers from the crowd. The Grizzlies' victory kept them competitive in the tight Western Conference standings.
