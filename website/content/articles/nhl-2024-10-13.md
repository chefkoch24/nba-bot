**Detroit Red Wings 3 - 0 Nashville Predators**  
Talbot makes 42 saves, shuts out Predators in 1st start with Red Wings
 **DETROIT --** <forge-entity title="Cam Talbot" slug="cam-talbot-8475660" code="player">Cam Talbot</forge-entity> made 42 saves in his first start for the Detroit Red Wings in a 3-0 win against the Nashville Predators at Little Caesars Arena on Saturday. 
Talbot's shutout was his 32nd in the NHL and comes two days after he made his Red Wings debut, relieving <forge-entity title="Ville Husso" slug="ville-husso-8478024" code="player">Ville Husso</forge-entity> in the second period of a 6-3 loss to the Pittsburgh Penguins in the season opener.

“I will take that performance anytime,” Talbot said. “I got my feet wet in the second and third period of our first game, and I tried to carry that over to tonight. Our guys were diving in front of everything, which goalies appreciate more than anything.”

Talbot signed a two-year, $5 million contract ($2.5 million average annual value) with Detroit on July 1.

“That’s a pretty good team over there, I don’t think they will be shut out many times this season,” Red Wings coach Derek Lalonde said. “It was a great defensive effort, starting with our goalie.” 
<forge-entity title="J.T. Compher" slug="j-t-compher-8477456" code="player">J.T. Compher</forge-entity>, <forge-entity title="Andrew Copp" slug="andrew-copp-8477429" code="player">Andrew Copp</forge-entity> and <forge-entity title="Dylan Larkin" slug="dylan-larkin-8477946" code="player">Dylan Larkin</forge-entity> scored for Detroit (1-1-0).

“Obviously, with the way we played defense tonight and the way \[Talbot\] played, we can get away with scoring two goals,” Copp said. “We know we can get goals -- it is definitely going to be about the number we give up.”

<forge-entity title="Juuse Saros" slug="juuse-saros-8477424" code="player">Juuse Saros</forge-entity> made 19 saves for Nashville (0-2-0). He missed the team's season-opening 4-3 loss to the Dallas Stars on Thursday with a lower-body injury.

“Talbot was great. We did enough to put some by him, but he was outstanding,” Predators coach Andrew Brunette said. “I think we let him see the puck a little too much.”

New Predators forwards <forge-entity title="Steven Stamkos" slug="steven-stamkos-8474564" code="player">Steven Stamkos</forge-entity> and <forge-entity title="Jonathan Marchessault" slug="jonathan-marchessault-8476539" code="player">Jonathan Marchessault</forge-entity> came into the game with a combined 34 goals in 58 games against Detroit but couldn’t beat Talbot with any of their eight shots.

“We’ve added some really good scorers, and I think we are deferring too much to them at times,” Burnette said. “We’re trying to be cuter when we need to be harder, and as we all know in this league, it is usually harder that wins, not cuter.” 
Compher gave the Red Wings a 1-0 lead at 1:02 of the second period, tipping <forge-entity title="Ben Chiarot" slug="ben-chiarot-8475279" code="player">Ben Chiarot</forge-entity>’s high shot past Saros.

Copp made it 2-0 at 6:35 of the third period, deflecting <forge-entity title="Lucas Raymond" slug="lucas-raymond-8482078" code="player">Lucas Raymond</forge-entity>’s pass into the crease.

Larkin scored into an empty net to make it 3-0 at 19:40.

“We’ve probably had four pretty good periods in the six we’ve played so far,” Lalonde said. “I’m glad we got rewarded for it tonight. Winning in this league is hard, so it can be very rewarding when it looks like that.”

**NOTES:** Red Wings forward <forge-entity title="Christian Fischer" slug="christian-fischer-8478432" code="player">Christian Fischer</forge-entity> left in the second period with an upper-body injury. Lalonde didn’t have an update after the game. … Red Wings defenseman [Albert Johansson](https://www.nhl.com/redwings/player/albert-johansson-8481607) played 11:57 with one shot on goal in his NHL debut.

**New York Rangers 5 - 6 Utah Hockey Club**  
Clayton Keller's second goal at 4:05 of overtime secured the Utah Hockey Club's 6-5 win over the New York Rangers, keeping Utah undefeated. Keller also notched an assist and capitalized on a defensive lapse by the Rangers to deliver the winning shot past Igor Shesterkin. Barrett Hayton contributed a goal and an assist as Utah maintained momentum from their previous overtime victory against the New York Islanders. Despite efforts from Artemi Panarin and Adam Fox, who had two goals and three assists respectively for the Rangers, Utah’s resilience and Dylan Guenther's significant contributions, with his power-play goal, underscored their offensive strengths. Notably, Guenther and Hayton joined an elite group with goals in each of the team's first three NHL games, contributing to Utah's historic high-scoring start to the season.

**Washington Capitals 3 - 5 New Jersey Devils**  
In an exciting 5-3 victory for the New Jersey Devils over the Washington Capitals, Paul Cotter stood out by scoring two goals, bringing his total to four in just four games this season. New Jersey's Tomas Tatar also contributed with a goal and an assist, while Erik Haula and Stefan Noesen each provided three assists. Goalie Jacob Markstrom made 29 saves for the Devils. Despite the loss, the Capitals saw strong performances from John Carlson and Dylan Strome, each with a goal and an assist, and goaltender Charlie Lindgren, who recorded 28 saves. Pierre-Luc Dubois impressed in his Capitals debut, and Matt Roy's early exit due to injury added to Washington's challenges. Cotter's remarkable start mirrors the achievement of Michael Cammalleri in the 2014-15 season, making him a standout player for the Devils.

**Dallas Stars 3 - 0 New York Islanders**  
Oettinger makes 34 saves, Stars shut out Islanders in home opener
 **DALLAS --** <forge-entity title="Jake Oettinger" slug="jake-oettinger-8479979" code="player">Jake Oettinger</forge-entity> made 34 saves for the Dallas Stars in a 3-0 win against the New York Islanders at American Airlines Center on Saturday. 
“It’s something I don’t take for granted at all,” Oettinger said of his 11th NHL shutout. “You need to get a little lucky and some guys need to help you out. A lot of things need to go right, so I never take them for granted. You just want to get the season going the right way. Good start.”

<forge-entity title="Tyler Seguin" slug="tyler-seguin-8475794" code="player">Tyler Seguin</forge-entity> had two goals, <forge-entity title="Jamie Benn" slug="jamie-benn-8473994" code="player">Jamie Benn</forge-entity> also scored and <forge-entity title="Mason Marchment" slug="mason-marchment-8478975" code="player">Mason Marchment</forge-entity> had two assists for the Stars (2-0-0) in their home opener.

“\[Oettinger\]’s rock-solid and we have a lot of belief in him,” Benn said. “Every night we feel like when we go on the ice we’re going to win because of him.”

<forge-entity title="Semyon Varlamov" slug="semyon-varlamov-8473575" code="player">Semyon Varlamov</forge-entity> made 24 saves for the Islanders (0-1-1).

“It’s a long season. It’s not a dream start. It’s not what we were thinking about in camp, but here we are,” Islanders forward <forge-entity title="Kyle Palmieri" slug="kyle-palmieri-8475151" code="player">Kyle Palmieri</forge-entity> said. “We knew it was going to be a tough road trip, but there’s positives to draw from it and definitely some things we can clean up." 
Seguin gave the Stars a 1-0 lead at 7:59 of the first period with a shot from the high slot.

“It’s early in the year and you get points by getting to your game quicker and having a great goaltender. That’s what’s happened in the first two games,” Seguin said.

The line of Seguin, <forge-entity title="Matt Duchene" slug="matt-duchene-8475168" code="player">Matt Duchene</forge-entity> and Marchment has factored in on four of Dallas’ seven goals in the first two games.

“\[My line got\] lots of experience last year during the regular season. We love to communicate,” Seguin said. “We work with each other in the summer on our game, and nice to see some rewards from that.”

Benn made it 2-0 at 10:58 of the second period. Two Islanders players overskated a loose puck in the slot, allowing Benn to collect it before beating Varlamov blocker side with a shot off the post.

“The chances they got, we made mistakes to give them that,” Islanders captain <forge-entity title="Anders Lee" slug="anders-lee-8475314" code="player">Anders Lee</forge-entity> said. “I think we turned back a few too many times. But other than that, it was a low-chance game with two goalies playing good hockey. We didn’t get the bounce we needed to just give us one, but you can’t have many mistakes against this team, and just a couple that cost us.” 
Islanders coach Patrick Roy said: “I thought today we had better jump. We were moving well on the ice. I thought there was a lot to like about this game. If we could just fix our turnovers coming out of our defensive zone coverage, we’ll be fine.”

Seguin scored into an empty net at 18:57 of the third period for the 3-0 final.

“The home opener, your natural reaction as a player is to try and put on a show. I thought we did a good job of playing within ourselves tonight. I don’t think we beat ourselves,” Stars coach Pete DeBoer said. “That’s a tough team to play against. They play a really structured game, and I thought we played a smart hockey game tonight. We didn’t turn it into a track meet or run-and-gun where everyone was trying to get points and put on a show. This is what it’s about. It’s about winning games.”

**NOTES:** Stars defenseman <forge-entity title="Matthew Dumba" slug="matt-dumba-8476856" code="player">Matthew Dumba</forge-entity> sustained a lower-body injury and did not play the second or third period. DeBoer said Dumba will have imaging done on Monday to determine the extent of his injury. He is considered day to day. … Seguin had his 50th multigoal game, which is fourth in Stars/Minnesota North Stars history.

The Columbus Blue Jackets secured a 6-4 victory over the Colorado Avalanche, with Sean Monahan, Kirill Marchenko, and Yegor Chinakhov each contributing a goal and two assists.

Zach Werenski and Kent Johnson scored for the second consecutive game, matching a rare feat within franchise history. Despite a challenging night for Colorado's goaltender Alexandar Georgiev, who was replaced after allowing three goals on nine shots, Nathan MacKinnon and Ross Colton made notable contributions with both players earning a goal and an assist each, while Cale Makar added two assists. The game highlighted both the Blue Jackets' balanced scoring power and the Avalanche's early-season struggles, as Colorado's coach Jared Bednar expressed confidence in Georgiev's future performance.

Notably, Huberdeau's opening goal came from an unusual deflection off his shoulder, marking the first time in his career that he scored in the first two games of a season. Nazem Kadri added two goals, while MacKenzie Weegar and Mikael Backlund also scored for the Flames. Despite strong contributions from Travis Konecny with two goals and Joel Farabee with one for the Flyers, they struggled to maintain momentum, hindered by penalties.

Meanwhile, Leon Draisaitl and Corey Perry provided the offense for Edmonton, but the Oilers struggled defensively as Calvin Pickard made 15 saves in his first start of the season.

 **SAN JOSE --** <forge-entity title="Lukas Dostal" slug="lukas-dostal-8480843" code="player">Lukas Dostal</forge-entity> made 30 saves for the Anaheim Ducks, who opened their season with a 2-0 win against the San Jose Sharks at SAP Center on Saturday. 
It was Dostal's second NHL shutout. It was also the first by a Ducks goalie in a season opener.

"Pucks were hitting me. The guys played a great game," Dostal said. "They blocked a lot of shots and really helped me out there."

<forge-entity title="Isac Lundestrom" slug="isac-lundestrom-8480806" code="player">Isac Lundestrom</forge-entity> and <forge-entity title="Trevor Zegras" slug="trevor-zegras-8481533" code="player">Trevor Zegras</forge-entity> scored in the third period for the Ducks (1-0-0).

"Dostal was a big difference for us," Anaheim coach Greg Cronin said. "If he's not on his game, this might've gone another direction." 
<forge-entity title="Vitek Vanecek" slug="vitek-vanecek-8477970" code="player">Vitek Vanecek</forge-entity> made 28 saves in his debut for the Sharks (0-1-1).

"I felt really good," said Vanecek, who was acquired in a trade with the New Jersey Devils on March 8. "The team played really good, too. We played good offensively and defensively. They helped me feel confident."

<forge-entity title="Macklin Celebrini" slug="macklin-celebrini-8484801" code="player">Macklin Celebrini</forge-entity>, who was selected by San Jose with the No. 1 pick in the 2024 NHL Draft, did not play and is out week to week with a lower-body injury.

"\[Celebrini\] is a special player. He's going to help us offensively. He's going to help the confidence of the group," Sharks defenseman <forge-entity title="Mario Ferraro" slug="mario-ferraro-8479983" code="player">Mario Ferraro</forge-entity> said. "He's a good person in the locker room. \[Even though he's\] a young guy, he leads a charge, too."

<forge-entity title="Fabian Zetterlund" slug="fabian-zetterlund-8480188" code="player">Fabian Zetterlund</forge-entity> appeared to give the Sharks a 1-0 lead at 2:38 of the first period, but Cronin challenged the play for offside, and the call was reversed after video review.

"I thought we played pretty well. We did a lot of good things, things that we've talked about from the start of training camp to yesterday," San Jose coach Ryan Warsofsky said. "Our guys are paying attention, and they're starting to execute a little bit more. But in this league, one mistake will cost your hockey game. So, we continue to learn." 
Lundestrom gave the Ducks a 1-0 lead at 11:00 of the third period. He took a pass from <forge-entity title="Brock McGinn" slug="brock-mcginn-8476934" code="player">Brock McGinn</forge-entity> on a rush and beat Vanecek glove side from the left hash marks.

"The \[fourth line\] hunted. They didn't change their game from the first shift," Cronin said. "They were putting pucks in deep and getting them back. They were getting zone time. They were really efficient at the offensive blue line. They deserved a goal."

Zegras scored into an empty net at 18:25 for the 2-0 final.
