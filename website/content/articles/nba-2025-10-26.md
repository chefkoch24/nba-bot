**Atlanta Hawks 100 - 117 Oklahoma City Thunder**  
In a commanding performance, the Oklahoma City Thunder, led by Chet Holmgren and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, secured a 117-100 victory over the depleted Atlanta Hawks. Holmgren tallied 31 points and 12 rebounds while excelling from beyond the arc, and Gilgeous-Alexander, building on his 55-point game against Indiana, chipped in 30 points, nearly perfect within the arc. This win advances the reigning NBA champions to a 3-0 season start, reminiscent of their previous seven-game winning streak at the beginning of the last season. Despite missing three starters, including Kristaps Porzingis and Jalen Johnson, the Hawks kept the game tight until Oklahoma City surged at the start of the third quarter, spearheading a decisive run. Notably, the game featured a family matchup between Thunderâ€™s Cason Wallace and Hawks' Keaton Wallace, although both had limited scoring impact. The Thunder will conclude their road trip in Dallas, while the Hawks begin a four-game road stint against the Chicago Bulls.

**Philadelphia 76ers 125 - 121 Charlotte Hornets**  
The Philadelphia 76ers staged a thrilling comeback to defeat the Charlotte Hornets 125-121 in their home opener, thanks to Quentin Grimes' clutch 3-pointer with 14 seconds left and a 28-point performance from Tyrese Maxey. Joel Embiid, managing a minutes restriction post-knee surgery, contributed 20 points but only two rebounds, sitting out the final quarter as Philadelphia erased a 10-point deficit. Despite Embiid's limited time on the court, the Sixers showcased their depth with VJ Edgecombe adding 15 points; Edgecombe previously scored 34 points in his debut against Boston, marking the third-highest debut score for an NBA player. The Hornets lost their early lead even amid a setback as Brandon Miller exited with a shoulder injury, leaving LaMelo Ball to lead their scoring with 27 points. The 76ers' depth and resilience, combined with key contributions from both seasoned and emerging players, paved the way to a notable triumph as they prepare to face Orlando on Monday.

**Memphis Grizzlies 128 - 103 Indiana Pacers**  
In a commanding 128-103 win over the Indiana Pacers, rookie Cedric Coward showcased an impressive performance for the Memphis Grizzlies by scoring 22 of his 27 points in the second half, including making all six of his three-point attempts. This marked Coward's consistent scoring achievement, as the No. 11 draft pick has achieved double figures in all three of his NBA games. Meanwhile, Ja Morant and Jaren Jackson Jr. added 19 and 17 points, respectively. The Grizzlies, rebounding from a heavy loss to the Miami Heat just the night before, seized control with a 17-2 run in the second quarter and never relinquished it despite a strong third-quarter stretch from Indiana's Bennedict Mathurin, who led the Pacers with 26 points. The Pacers, still without a win after also losing their double-overtime opener to Oklahoma City, will face Minnesota next, while the Grizzlies prepare to meet the Golden State Warriors.

**Denver Nuggets 133 - 111 Phoenix Suns**  
The Phoenix Suns, who marked Jordan Ott's first NBA head coaching victory with a season-opening win, faced a challenging task on Saturday night against the Denver Nuggets. The Suns, coming off a heavy 129-102 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers, are dealing with the absence of Jalen Green due to a hamstring injury, although Dillon Brooks has been impressive, averaging 21.5 points in the first two games. Despite Devin Booker's strong performances, the Suns appear fatigued ahead of their matchup with Denver. The Nuggets, despite losing in overtime to Golden State, showcased Aaron Gordon's career-high 50-point performance and a triple-double from Nikola Jokic. For the Nuggets, Saturday's home game marks their season opener, reinforcing a retooled roster featuring newcomers Jonas Valanciunas, Tim Hardaway Jr., and a healthy Jamal Murray, who is in prime condition following a summer of focused preparation. The additions aim to provide valuable rest for key players like Jokic as Denver aspires for another title run under new head coach David Adelman.
