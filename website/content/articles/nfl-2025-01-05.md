**Baltimore Ravens 35 - 10 Cleveland Browns**  
The Baltimore Ravens secured the AFC North title for the second consecutive year with a dominant 35-10 victory over the Cleveland Browns. Lamar Jackson had an outstanding performance, throwing two touchdown passes, and concluded the season with impressive stats: 4,172 passing yards, 41 touchdown passes, and only four interceptions, making him a strong MVP contender. Jackson became the first quarterback to pass for over 4,000 yards and rush for over 800 in a season. The Ravens will face the Los Angeles Chargers or the Pittsburgh Steelers in the playoffs. Meanwhile, Derek Henry celebrated his 31st birthday with two touchdowns, finishing the season with a franchise-record 16 rushing touchdowns. Cleveland struggled, with both Bailey Zappe and Dorian Thompson-Robinson unable to generate much offense against the Ravens. This difficult season leaves the Browns looking forward to the draft after ending with six consecutive losses. The game was marred by injuries, including a concerning knee injury for Baltimore's top receiver, Zay Flowers.

**Pittsburgh Steelers 17 - 19 Cincinnati Bengals**  
Joe Burrow and the Cincinnati Bengals managed to keep their playoff hopes alive with a narrow 19-17 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers, thanks largely to Burrow's 277 passing yards and a touchdown despite an interception. The Bengals, having struggled earlier with a 4-8 record, finished the regular season with a five-game winning streak, showcasing Burrow's MVP-caliber performance and a strengthened defense that held Pittsburgh to just 193 yards. Ja'Marr Chase impressed with 10 catches for 96 yards, contributing to Cincinnati's resilient offensive push, while Trey Hendrickson's 3.5 sacks led a defensive effort that stymied the Steelers' playoff-bound ambitions. The Bengals' postseason fate now depends on outcomes involving Kansas City and the New York Jets, as they hope to jump into the AFC playoff picture. Despite injuries to key players like Tee Higgins, Cincinnati displayed determination in closing out the game effectively, while the Steelers face their own challenges as they approach their playoff matchups with a four-game losing streak.
