**Oklahoma City Thunder 124 - 94 Minnesota Timberwolves**  
The Oklahoma City Thunder secured a spot in the NBA Finals for the first time since 2012 by defeating the Minnesota Timberwolves 124-94, winning the Western Conference finals series 4-1. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the charge with 34 points, while Chet Holmgren contributed 22 points, seven rebounds, and three blocks. Despite the decisive victory, the team maintained focus on their ultimate goal, with the league MVP emphasizing there is more work to be done. Coach Mark Daigneault praised his players' character, even as they lightheartedly draped towels over him during a postgame interview. Oklahoma City's fanbase, having endured the departure of Kevin Durant in 2016 and subsequent rebuilding years, celebrated as the starters exited with a comfortable lead. The Timberwolves' Julius Randle and Anthony Edwards scored 24 and 19 points, respectively, but Minnesota struggled with shooting and committed 21 turnovers. Timberwolves veteran Mike Conley reflected on the loss, recognizing the missed opportunity while expressing pride in his team's effort. The Thunder will face either the Indiana Pacers or New York Knicks in the finals, with Indiana leading their series 3-1.
