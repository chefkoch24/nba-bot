**Indiana Pacers 126 - 124 Milwaukee Bucks**  
In a high-scoring game, Giannis Antetokounmpo scored a season-high 54 points, but it wasn't enough as Tyrese Haliburton and the Indiana Pacers rallied for a 126-124 win over the Milwaukee Bucks. Haliburton led the way for the Pacers with 29 points and 10 assists, while Antetokounmpo fell just short of his career high with 54 points. The Pacers blew an 18-point lead, but managed to come back from a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter to secure the victory. The Bucks, playing without Damian Lillard, received a 19-point performance from Khris Middleton, but ultimately fell short. This win marked the Pacers' second consecutive victory, with the Bucks set to face the Orlando Magic next while the Pacers will take on the Philadelphia 76ers.

**Orlando Magic 119 - 120 Atlanta Hawks**  
Trae Young scored 41 points and assisted Dejounte Murray on a go-ahead 3-pointer in the final seconds as the Atlanta Hawks narrowly beat the Orlando Magic 120-119 in Mexico City. Despite a strong performance from Jalen Suggs and Paolo Banchero, the Magic fell short on their final possession. The game marked the first time the Hawks played in Mexico City, and the sellout crowd created an electric atmosphere at an altitude of over 7,000 feet. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver hinted at the possibility of expanding the league to Mexico, with potential for a franchise in the future. The Hawks will host the Miami Heat next, while the Magic will host the Milwaukee Bucks.
