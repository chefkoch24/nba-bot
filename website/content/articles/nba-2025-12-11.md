**Oklahoma City Thunder 138 - 89 Phoenix Suns**  
In a thrilling game, the Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Phoenix Suns 123-119, extending their impressive winning streak to 15 games, which ties a franchise record and makes them the third team in NBA history to win at least 23 of their first 24 games. The Thunder's aggressive play style and strong defense have been key to their success, allowing them to edge out opponents, including the Suns in their previous encounter. Despite the absence of their star player Shai Gilgeous-Alexander in a recent win over Utah, the Thunder have maintained their momentum. The Suns, dealing with injuries to key players like Devin Booker, who is questionable to return for the rematch, rely on the competitive drive of Dillon Brooks to keep them competitive. Both teams are preparing for a crucial NBA Cup quarterfinal matchup, with the stakes high as the winner will advance to face either the Los Angeles Lakers or San Antonio Spurs in Las Vegas.

**Los Angeles Lakers 119 - 132 San Antonio Spurs**  
In a thrilling NBA Cup journey, the Los Angeles Lakers and San Antonio Spurs will clash in a West semifinal, both coming off impressive runs. The Lakers have won nine of their last 11 games, bolstered by LeBron James' impactful return and his season-high 29 points, including crucial late-game three-pointers in a win over the 76ers. Meanwhile, the Spurs, thriving despite missing Victor Wembanyama, secured a 135-132 victory against the Pelicans, led by Harrison Barnes' 24 points and the bench prowess of rookie Dylan Harper. San Antonio has shown long-range efficiency without their star, shooting 47.2% from beyond the arc. The Lakers, notoriously weak in defending the three-point shot, eagerly anticipate Marcus Smart's return to bolster their perimeter defense. With a glorious past encounter, where the Lakers edged out a narrow victory over the Spurs, the stakes are high as Wednesday's winner will head to Las Vegas for the West final and potentially face an NBA litmus test against the Oklahoma City Thunder, assuming they overcome the Phoenix Suns.
