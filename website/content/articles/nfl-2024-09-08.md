**Eagles 34 - 29 Packers**  
Saquon Barkley made an impressive debut for the Philadelphia Eagles, scoring three touchdowns and leading the team to a 34-29 victory over the Green Bay Packers in the first NFL game held in South America. This game also saw an unfortunate injury to Packers' quarterback Jordan Love in the final seconds, leaving his status uncertain after signing a substantial contract extension earlier this year. Jalen Hurts contributed significantly for the Eagles with two touchdowns and two interceptions, while A.J. Brown added a 67-yard touchdown reception. On Green Bayï¿½s side, Jayden Reed stood out with a 33-yard jet sweep touchdown and a 70-yard reception, making him the first player since Jim Brown in 1963 to achieve such a feat in a season opener. However, Love's injury and missed opportunities cost the Packers dearly, as they were forced to settle for field goals on early turnovers and couldn't capitalize on key red-zone chances. The game, hosted at Sao Paulo's NeoQuimica Arena, was played on a slippery surface that likely contributed to a turnover-filled first half.
