**Los Angeles Lakers 116 - 97 Cleveland Cavaliers**  
D'Angelo Russell scored 28 points and LeBron James added 24 as the Los Angeles Lakers beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 116-97, moving into eighth place in the Western Conference with their fourth straight win. Anthony Davis had 22 points and 13 rebounds, helping the Lakers to their ninth win in 10 games. Despite the win, the Lakers are still in the play-in tournament position, but finishing in seventh or eighth would require only one win for a playoff spot. The Cavaliers, led by Darius Garland's 26 points, dropped their third game in their last four. LeBron improved to 18-4 against the Cavs, the team he led to a championship in 2016, and the Lakers are now focused on maintaining momentum heading into the postseason.

Joel Embiid scored 30 points and grabbed 12 rebounds in only 23 minutes to lead the 76ers to a 116-96 victory over the Grizzlies. This marks Philadelphia's fourth consecutive win as they aim to move up in the Eastern Conference standings. Embiid, who is still working his way back from knee surgery, acknowledges he is still adjusting to the pace of the game. The Grizzlies, who were short-handed with 13 players not dressing, could not contain Embiid in the first half as the 76ers built a 62-42 halftime lead. Philadelphia outscored Memphis 34-19 in the second quarter and maintained a comfortable lead throughout the game. Despite the win, Embiid states that the team is focused on playing good basketball and getting healthy rather than worrying about playoff seeding.
