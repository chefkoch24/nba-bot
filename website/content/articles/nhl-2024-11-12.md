**Buffalo Sabres 5 - 7 Montreal Canadiens**  
The Montreal Canadiens snapped a six-game losing streak by defeating the Buffalo Sabres 7-5 at KeyBank Center, aided by Cole Caufield’s standout performance with two goals, including a crucial power-play tally that gave Montreal a lead they wouldn’t relinquish. This victory was highlighted by Nick Suzuki’s contribution, scoring twice and assisting twice, reaching his 300th NHL point. Despite Cayden Primeau’s struggles in goal, conceding five goals on 14 shots, Sam Montembeault stepped in to secure the win with four saves. For the Sabres, Dylan Cozens and Rasmus Dahlin each recorded a goal and an assist, although Buffalo's defense faltered when it mattered, failing to protect leads throughout the game. Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen and Devon Levi shared the goaltending duties for Buffalo, but couldn’t prevent the Canadiens' rally. The game also marked Caufield’s move past Alex Galchenyuk for the fourth-most game-winning goals by a Montreal player before age 24, and his efforts were complemented by Suzuki’s significant milestone in his young career. Buffalo suffered injuries to key players Tage Thompson and Mattias Samuelsson, providing further challenges as the team grapples with inconsistency after a recent three-game winning streak.

**Philadelphia Flyers 4 - 3 San Jose Sharks**  
In his return to the Philadelphia Flyers lineup, Matvei Michkov showcased an impressive performance with a goal, an assist, and a key shootout score, leading the team to a 4-3 victory over the San Jose Sharks. Michkov, who had been scratched for the previous two games, contributed to the Flyers' early 3-0 lead, with Erik Johnson and Travis Konecny also finding the net, and later helped secure their third consecutive game with a point. Samuel Ersson made 27 saves and was crucial in the shootout, while the Sharks battled back from their deficit with goals from Jack Thompson, Mikael Granlund, and Barclay Goodrow, only to fall short. Notably, Michkov, at 19, has four multipoint games this season, tying him for sixth most by a Flyers teenager. Meanwhile, Sharks rookie William Eklund provided two assists, but coach Ryan Warsofsky acknowledged his team's struggle to maintain the energy from their previous win over the New Jersey Devils. The encounter also pitted the NHL's oldest coach, John Tortorella, against its youngest, signaling an interesting coaching dynamic.
