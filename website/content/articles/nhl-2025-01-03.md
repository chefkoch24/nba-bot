**Florida Panthers 1 - 3 Carolina Hurricanes**  
The Carolina Hurricanes secured a 3-1 victory over the Florida Panthers, thanks to Jaccob Slavin's decisive third-period goal which came amidst a controversial play involving interference with Florida's goaltender, Sergei Bobrovsky. The decision was not challenged by the Panthers as it was determined that Matthew Tkachuk’s involvement caused the contact with Bobrovsky. Brent Burns and Martin Necas also scored for Carolina, with Necas sealing the win with an empty-net goal. The Hurricanes ended a streak of poor road performances, having lost eight of their previous nine away games, while Pyotr Kochetkov contributed significantly with 25 saves. Florida’s Anton Lundell scored their lone goal in the second period, with Bobrovsky making 37 saves in a losing effort. Notably, Bobrovsky played his 269th game with the Panthers, surpassing John Vanbiesbrouck on the franchise's all-time list for games played by a goaltender, while Juha Jaaska made his NHL debut for the Hurricanes.

Cam Talbot and Elvis Merzlikins each made 21 saves for their respective teams. Despite a dynamic early play from Columbus, Zach Werenski emphasized the need for a full 60-minute performance, as lapses allowed Detroit to repeatedly come back, highlighting the grit and determination instilled by McLellan in this emergent Red Wings team.

In an exciting overtime victory, the Anaheim Ducks defeated the Winnipeg Jets 4-3 at Canada Life Centre, marking their third consecutive win. Troy Terry was pivotal, scoring twice, including the game-winner during a dramatic 2-on-1 break while the Anaheim net was off its moorings.

Gibson, praised by teammates for his steady presence, also assisted on the overtime winner, claiming his seventh career point and moving into second place for most career points by a Ducks goaltender. The Ducks' rally marked their fourth multi-goal comeback of the season, tying them for second most in the NHL. Leo Carlsson became the youngest player in Ducks history to score his 20th NHL goal, underscoring the team's blend of youthful talent and veteran leadership. Despite the Jets' strong start, with goals from Mark Scheifele, Adam Lowry, and Alex Iafallo, missed opportunities and turnovers proved costly in their second straight loss.
