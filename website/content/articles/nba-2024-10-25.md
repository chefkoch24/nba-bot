**Washington Wizards 102 - 122 Boston Celtics**  
In their first road game of the season, the Boston Celtics maintained their dominance with a decisive 122-102 victory over the Washington Wizards. Jayson Tatum led the effort with 25 points and 11 rebounds, while Jaylen Brown added 27 points. The Celtics extended their winning streak against the Wizards to five games, benefiting from a third-quarter surge where they outscored Washington 34-19. Despite a promising first half for the Wizards, their young lineup, featuring rookies Alex Sarr and Bub Carrington, struggled after halftime. Carrington's game ended after a potential injury from a fall in the fourth quarter. Notably, the Wizards fielded the youngest starting lineup in the NBA this season, averaging 22.72 years of age, a first for the franchise since starter tracking began in 1970. Both teams are set to play again on Saturday, with Boston visiting Detroit and Washington facing Cleveland at home.

In the Mavericks' season opener, Klay Thompson impressed with 22 points in his debut for Dallas, complementing Luka Doncic's 28-point, 10-rebound performance as they defeated the San Antonio Spurs 120-109. The game also featured the debut of Chris Paul with the Spurs, marking an important moment for the team despite his modest scoring of just three points, as he contributed with eight assists and seven reboundsâ€”showing his long-term potential value. Despite rough spots, Dallas showcased a defensive spark in the third quarter with multiple steals leading to a brief scoring surge. The Mavericks capitalized on their three-point shooting in the second half, drastically improving to 13 of 21 from deep, a stark contrast to their first half struggles. Meanwhile, Victor Wembanyama, in his second year, struggled with his shooting but still managed 17 points for a young Spurs squad aiming to break a long playoff absence. The Mavericks head to Phoenix next, while the Spurs prepare for consecutive home games against Houston.

**Denver Nuggets 87 - 102 Oklahoma City Thunder**  
In their season opener, the Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Denver Nuggets 102-87, with standout performances by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who scored 28 points, and rookie Chet Holmgren, who contributed 25 points, 14 rebounds, 5 assists, and 4 blocks. This divisional matchup was significant as both teams finished last season with identical 57-25 records, with the Thunder securing the top seed in the Western Conference. Despite reigning MVP Nikola Jokic's triple-double performance of 16 points, 13 assists, and 12 rebounds, the Nuggets struggled with their shooting, going 7-of-39 from beyond the arc. The game also featured a tribute to the late Dikembe Mutombo, with Denver players wearing T-shirts honoring him and fans applauding for 55 seconds to commemorate his jersey number. The Thunder, boasting the youngest roster in the NBA, will face the Chicago Bulls next, while the Nuggets prepare to host the Los Angeles Clippers.

**Sacramento Kings 115 - 117 Minnesota Timberwolves**  
In an exciting opening game for the Sacramento Kings, the Minnesota Timberwolves emerged victorious with a 117-115 win, thanks to Anthony Edwards' clutch free throws with 2.4 seconds left. Edwards, who was fouled by Domantas Sabonis, secured 32 points, while Julius Randle led the team with 33 points in his second game after joining from New York. Despite a strong debut from DeMar DeRozan, who led the Kings with 26 points, and contributions from Sabonis and Keegan Murray with 24 and 23 points respectively, Murray's last-second three-pointer was off the mark. The Timberwolves bounced back from a loss to the Lakers, using an 11-0 run highlighted by Edwards and Naz Reid's key three-pointers to turn the game in their favor. They achieved this win by significantly improving their three-point shooting to 20-for-50, marking a franchise record of 91 attempts in their first two games. Sacramento's unfortunate streak continued, marking their sixth consecutive home opener loss since 2013. The Timberwolves will host Toronto next, while Sacramento heads to Los Angeles to face the Lakers.
