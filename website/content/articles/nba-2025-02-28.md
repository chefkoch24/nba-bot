In a thrilling showdown, Stephen Curry delivered an electrifying performance by scoring a season-high 56 points to lead the Golden State Warriors to a 121-115 comeback victory over the Orlando Magic. Curry was in sublime form, hitting 12 of 19 shots from beyond the arc, and amassed 22 points just in the third quarter, where the Warriors rallied from a 14-point deficit to take a five-point lead. His stellar play featured an NBA-record 26th career game with at least 10 three-pointers, and he went a perfect 12-for-12 from the free-throw line, marking Golden State's fifth consecutive win. Meanwhile, Orlando's Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner put up 41 and 27 points, respectively, but were outpaced as the Magic succumbed to their 14th loss in 20 games, hampered by 18 crucial turnovers. A pivotal moment came as Quinten Post contributed 18 points off the bench for the Warriors, who also capitalized on a defensive stretch that held the Magic scoreless for the opening minutes of the fourth quarter. Draymond Green's double-double and Jimmy Butler's seven assists, since his acquisition, added depth to the victory. Curry's standout feat of nailing a halfcourt shot at the halftime buzzer exemplified his sheer dominance and edged the Warriors closer before they finished off in control.

**Dallas Mavericks 103 - 96 Charlotte Hornets**  
The Dallas Mavericks secured a 103-96 win over the Charlotte Hornets, powered by Kyrie Irving's 18-point second-half surge and nine rebounds. In a notable performance, Moses Brown, nearing the end of his 10-day contract, contributed 20 points and 11 rebounds in his first start for Dallas. Despite Mark Williams' standout 26 points and 16 rebounds for the Hornets, the team faced their fifth consecutive loss and a troubling 1-21 record without LaMelo Ball, who missed the game due to an ankle injury. This matchup highlighted Charlotte's struggles, including their 1-8 record from a lengthy nine-game road trip. For the Mavericks, this victory placed them ninth in the Western Conference, just one game away from a desired playoff berth. Additionally, Brown's scoring was his highest since his Oklahoma City days, and Irving's crucial tip-out to Klay Thompson, leading to a significant 3-pointer, helped seal the game.
