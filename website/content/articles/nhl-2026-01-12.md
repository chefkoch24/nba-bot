**Nashville Predators 3 - 2 Washington Capitals**  
In a commanding 4-1 victory over the Nashville Predators, Alex Ovechkin scored his 873rd NHL goal, bringing him within 22 goals of Wayne Gretzky’s all-time record. The win, which extended the Washington Capitals' point streak to seven games, featured Ethen Frank scoring his first NHL goal and assists from Tom Wilson and Andrew Mangiapane. The team's success was underscored by strong performances from Logan Thompson, who made 32 saves, and Ovechkin becoming the second player in NHL history to score at least 20 goals in 20 consecutive seasons, a feat only Gordie Howe has surpassed with 22 seasons. Washington's strategy of performing best in crucial moments was highlighted by coach Spencer Carbery, while Nashville's coach Andrew Brunette expressed frustration over the team's ongoing challenges, despite Filip Forsberg's goal. The match also saw Nashville's Steven Stamkos return from an injury, contributing no shots during his 20 minutes on the ice.
