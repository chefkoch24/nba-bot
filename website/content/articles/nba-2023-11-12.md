Donovan Mitchell led the Cleveland Cavaliers to a 118-110 victory over Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors, with Mitchell putting up 21 points, seven rebounds, five assists, and two steals.

Curry scored 30 points for the Warriors, who lost Green in the third quarter. This win marked Cleveland's first victory on the Warriors' home floor since 2014 and their first series sweep since 2008-09.

**Orlando Magic 112 - 97 Milwaukee Bucks**  
Paolo Banchero and the Wagner brothers powered the Orlando Magic to a 112-97 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks, snapping the Bucks' 14-game win streak against the Magic. Banchero had 26 points and 12 rebounds, while Franz Wagner scored 24 and Mo Wagner added 19 off the bench. Giannis Antetokounmpo led the Bucks with 35 points, 10 rebounds, and seven assists, but it was not enough to overcome the Magic's strong performance. The win improved the Magic's record to 5-4, marking a turnaround from their start last season. Antetokounmpo voiced frustration with his team's defense, as they allowed the Magic to attempt 35 free throws. The loss was the Bucks' second straight, and they will look to bounce back against the Chicago Bulls next.

**Boston Celtics 117 - 94 Toronto Raptors**  
In a dominating performance, the Boston Celtics led by Jaylen Brown's 29 points and Jayson Tatum's 27 points cruised to a 117-94 victory over the Toronto Raptors. Kristaps Porzingis added 21 points and seven rebounds as the Celtics won their second consecutive game, showcasing their offensive prowess. The Raptors, who had won their last two games on the road, struggled to make 3-pointers and were unable to keep up with Boston's scoring. The game was marked by controversy as Boston coach Joe Mazzulla successfully used a challenge late in the game, causing tension with the Raptors. With both Brown and Tatum playing at an elite level, the Celtics look to continue their strong performance as they face the New York Knicks next.
