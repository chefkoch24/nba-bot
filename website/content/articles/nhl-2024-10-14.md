**Dallas Stars 2 - 0 Seattle Kraken**  
DeSmith, Stars shut out Kraken to stay undefeated
 **DALLAS --** <forge-entity title="Casey DeSmith" slug="casey-desmith-8479193" code="player">Casey DeSmith</forge-entity> made 25 saves in his debut for the Dallas Stars, who defeated the Seattle Kraken 2-0 at American Airlines Center on Sunday. 
“What I liked about Casey’s game is how calm he looked in the net. He looked like he was in control and unflappable,” Dallas coach Pete DeBoer said. “We’ve got a smart group. We know that defense gives you a chance to win every night in this league, and if you defend hard and get good goaltending, you can give yourself a chance every night. If you don’t, you’ve probably put yourself in a lot tougher spot.”

<forge-entity title="Sam Steel" slug="sam-steel-8479351" code="player">Sam Steel</forge-entity> and <forge-entity title="Wyatt Johnston" slug="wyatt-johnston-8482740" code="player">Wyatt Johnston</forge-entity> scored for Dallas (3-0-0), which has back-to-back shutouts after <forge-entity title="Jake Oettinger" slug="jake-oettinger-8479979" code="player">Jake Oettinger</forge-entity> made 34 saves in a 3-0 win against the New York Islanders on Saturday.

“That was a blast. In front of the home crowd, obviously the guys played great. It feels good to participate and help the boys get a win,” said DeSmith, who signed a three-year, $3 million contract ($1 million average annual value) with the Stars on July 1. “\[Back-to-back shutouts are\] really rare. I don’t know that I’ve ever been a part of that. Probably not. What a way to start the year. Just shows that we’re playing the right way and hopefully that keeps going.” 
<forge-entity title="Philipp Grubauer" slug="philipp-grubauer-8475831" code="player">Philipp Grubauer</forge-entity> made 21 saves for Seattle (1-2-0).

“I thought \[Grubauer\] played really well,” Seattle coach Dan Bylsma said. “Couple of times in the first period there were a couple of barrages around the net and he stood strong. In the third period, they got the two breakaways that \[he\] came up big on and kept us in the game and gave us a chance.”

Seattle was coming off a 5-4 shootout win at the Minnesota Wild on Saturday.

“Although it’s a back-to-back and you might be tired, it is game three,” Seattle defenseman <forge-entity title="Brandon Montour" slug="brandon-montour-8477986" code="player">Brandon Montour</forge-entity> said. “There should be no excuse, especially going against a team like Dallas who is a top-end team in the West. Especially a team that’s looking to get over the hump and get a good run in the playoffs. That’s one that you should just kind of be up for.”

Steel gave Dallas a 1-0 lead at 16:17 of the first period with a tap-in at the right post.

“Points matter the same, no matter if it’s game one or 82. To get off to a great start, it’s just good to get points in the bank early,” Steel said. “It’s just nice not having to play catchup. It’s only three games, there’s still a lot of improvement for us to be made, but for the most part we’ve been pretty solid.”

Johnston scored 13 seconds later at 16:30 to make it 2-0 when he picked the top corner blocker side from the right face-off dot.

“They’re a fast transition team. I think we can do a better job of shutting it down earlier, but it cost us one goal tonight,” Seattle defenseman <forge-entity title="Adam Larsson" slug="adam-larsson-8476457" code="player">Adam Larsson</forge-entity> said.

Dallas has had seven different players score its nine goals this season.

“That’s one thing we take pride in is our depth. You need everyone to chip in,” Johnston said. “It’s great that it’s been spread out so far. I think that’s what makes us really tough is we’ve got four lines that can score and make plays.” 
Grubauer kept it a two-goal game by stopping two breakaways in the third period, the first on <forge-entity title="Tyler Seguin" slug="tyler-seguin-8475794" code="player">Tyler Seguin</forge-entity> at 7:03 and then <forge-entity title="Mason Marchment" slug="mason-marchment-8478975" code="player">Mason Marchment</forge-entity> at 14:01.

“He had a really strong game. He’s been really good for us throughout camp and the first couple of games,” Larsson said. “We didn’t score enough goals today.”

**NOTES:** Dallas defenseman <forge-entity title="Mathew Dumba" slug="matt-dumba-8476856" code="player">Mathew Dumba</forge-entity> did not play and is day to day because of a lower-body injury sustained in the first period against the Islanders. … Seattle defenseman <forge-entity title="Vince Dunn" slug="vince-dunn-8478407" code="player">Vince Dunn</forge-entity> did not play and is day to day because of an upper-body injury he sustained against the Wild. … It was the second time in Stars/Minnesota North Stars history that they have had shutouts on consecutive days (Dec. 15-16, 1967).

**Edmonton Oilers 1 - 4 Calgary Flames**  
The Calgary Flames secured a commanding 4-1 victory over the Edmonton Oilers, maintaining their undefeated streak at 3-0-0. Standout performances included Rasmus Andersson, who notched a goal and two assists, and Justin Kirkland, who celebrated his first NHL goal. Dan Vladar contributed with 25 saves, thwarting multiple Oilers' attempts, including two potential goals overturned by video review due to goaltender interference and offside violations. Edmonton, led by Connor McDavid, remains winless at 0-3-0 for the first time since the 2015-16 season, struggling offensively as they have been outscored 15-3 at home. Skinner's early goal, his first of the season, briefly gave the Oilers hope, but Calgary's strategic and resilient play—highlighted by Andersson’s tying goal and Anthony Mantha’s decisive score—carried them to victory. Despite the setback, McDavid expressed determination to improve, emphasizing the team's resilience and potential to climb out of their current slump.

Keegan Kolesar had a notable performance with two assists, including crucial plays leading to Hertl's and Dorofeyev's goals. The Ducks' Troy Terry tied the game in the first period, but Anaheim struggled in the second period due to turnovers, affecting their ability to maintain momentum. This win marked Vegas's third consecutive season with a 3-0-0 start, making them only the fourth team in NHL history to achieve such a streak three years in a row. Jack Eichel added to his impressive start of the season with a secondary assist on Hertl's goal, accumulating seven points in three games—the most in the team's history for such a span.
