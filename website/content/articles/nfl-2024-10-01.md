**Detroit Lions 42 - 29 Seattle Seahawks**  
In a thrilling Monday night game, Jared Goff set an NFL record by completing all 18 of his passes, leading the Detroit Lions to a 42-29 victory over the Seattle Seahawks. This feat eclipsed Kurt Warner's previous mark of 10 consecutive completions set in 2005. The game also featured a unique moment where wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown threw a touchdown pass to Goff, marking the first time Goff caught a touchdown in his career. Goff threw for 292 yards and two touchdowns, including a trick-play score with St. Brown, who also caught a touchdown pass from Goff. Despite a late safety and a persistent effort from Seattle’s Geno Smith, who threw for 395 yards, the injury-plagued Seahawks couldn't keep pace. The Lions’ run game, powered by Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery, further bolstered their offense. Key defensive stops and timely scoring drives sealed Seattle’s first loss of the season.

**Miami Dolphins 12 - 31 Tennessee Titans**  
Mason Rudolph stepped in to lead the Tennessee Titans to their first win of the season, securing a 31-12 victory over the Miami Dolphins after starting quarterback Will Levis was sidelined with a shoulder injury early in the game. Rudolph, along with the help of Nick Folk’s five field goals and a strong rushing performance from Tony Pollard and Tyjae Spears, managed seven scoring drives. The Dolphins, struggling without injured Tua Tagovailoa and with newly signed Tyler Huntley at the helm, couldn't overcome offensive miscues and turnovers, including a backward pass fumble and an interception on a two-point conversion. Despite a brief comeback attempt, Miami's offense was largely contained, and their frustration was evident with multiple execution errors, leading to boos from the crowd at Hard Rock Stadium. Both teams suffered significant injuries, with Levis likely benefiting from the Titans' upcoming bye week.
