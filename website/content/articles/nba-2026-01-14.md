**Miami Heat 127 - 121 Phoenix Suns**  
Bam Adebayo led the Miami Heat to a thrilling 127-121 victory over the Phoenix Suns, scoring 29 points and hitting crucial jumpers in the final minutes. Norman Powell added 27 points, including a decisive 3-pointer with 48 seconds left, while Andrew Wiggins sealed the win with late free throws after Dillon Brooks' flagrant foul. Adebayo's performance boosted his career points to 9,461, surpassing Alonzo Mourning for second place on Miami's all-time scoring list. Despite Miami's early 20-point lead, the Suns mounted a comeback, tying the game and even taking the lead in the fourth quarter with contributions from Devin Booker, who nearly achieved a triple-double, and Mark Williams. However, Miami's resilience broke their three-game losing streak, and Phoenix's efforts to overcome a large deficit fell short, dropping them to 0-11 in such scenarios this season.

**Houston Rockets 119 - 113 Chicago Bulls**  
In an exciting back-and-forth game featuring 35 lead changes, the Houston Rockets triumphed over the Chicago Bulls with a 119-113 victory, ending their three-game losing streak. Kevin Durant led the Rockets with 28 points, while Alperen Sengun contributed 23 points and 11 assists. Despite trailing by one point with about 3.5 minutes remaining, the Rockets mounted a crucial 7-2 run, highlighted by Durant's thunderous dunk and Jabari Smith Jr.'s pivotal three-pointer, to seize control of the game. Smith's impressive performance in the fourth quarter, with 10 of his 18 points, was instrumental in securing the win. Tre Jones led the struggling Bulls, who have now lost four out of their last five games, with a career-high 34 points. Despite their efforts, including timely three-pointers from Isaac Okoro and Ayo Dosunmu, the Bulls couldn't maintain their lead. The Rockets managed only 4 of 20 on three-point attempts until a crucial shot by Amen Thompson restored their lead. Missteps, including a turnover by Durant, briefly gave Chicago hope, but the Rockets' late push, capped by Durant's final dunk, sealed their victory.

**Los Angeles Lakers 141 - 116 Atlanta Hawks**  
The Atlanta Hawks, riding a three-game winning surge, visited the LA Lakers with a newly revamped lineup, including CJ McCollum and Corey Kispert, who contributed to a 124-111 win over the Golden State Warriors prior. McCollum, praised for his gameplay acumen by coach Quin Snyder, helped lead the charge as one of six Hawks hitting double-digit points, notably highlighted by Nickeil Alexander-Walker's 24 points, Jalen Johnson's 23 points and 11 rebounds, and Luke Kennard's season-high 22 points, showcasing his aggression from beyond the arc. Meanwhile, the Lakers returned home from a third consecutive loss to the Sacramento Kings, despite a 42-point performance from Luka Doncic and another 22 from LeBron James, as concerns loomed over their poor 3-point shooting percentage and limited impact from key starters. Injuries continue to sideline critical players for both teams, with Rui Hachimura expected to see limited action against Atlanta after sitting out multiple games, and Austin Reaves remaining unavailable. The Hawks had previously defeated the Lakers in a decisive 122-102 game in November, marking the start of their best winning run this season.

**Golden State Warriors 95 - 71 Portland Trail Blazers**  
As the Golden State Warriors prepared to host the Portland Trail Blazers, speculation surrounded Jonathan Kuminga's status with the team. The Warriors' former No. 7 overall draft pick, currently benched for 12 consecutive games amid trade rumors, recently secured a two-year contract extension but could potentially be traded after January 15. Golden State's coach, Steve Kerr, attributed Kuminga's benching to an uninspiring recent performance, although some suggest trade discussions or disciplinary reasons might explain his absence. The Warriors have managed an 8-4 record without Kuminga but recently fell to the Atlanta Hawks. On the other side, the Trail Blazers, who have surprised the Warriors with three consecutive wins this season, might engage in trade talks for Kuminga given their roster featuring veteran options like Jrue Holiday, Jerami Grant, and Robert Williams, the latter having performed well against the Knicks. While the Trail Blazers anticipate Jerami Grant's return from injury and Jrue Holiday continues to find his form post-calf strain, the young core of Deni Avdija, Shaedon Sharpe, Toumani Camara, and Donovan Clingan have fueled their recent success, aiming for a season-series sweep against Golden State for the first time since 2003.
