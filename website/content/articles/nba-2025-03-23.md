**Indiana Pacers 108 - 103 Brooklyn Nets**  
The Indiana Pacers fended off the Brooklyn Nets with a 108-103 victory, thanks to Pascal Siakam's crucial eight points in the final minutes and Myles Turner's impressive five 3-pointers contributing to his 22 points. Despite a challenging moment before the game when Turner's sister was stretchered off, he also managed to grab eight rebounds and block three shots. Tyrese Haliburton, returning from a back injury, notched his 10th consecutive double-double with 16 points and 12 assists, aiding Indiana in sweeping the two-game home series against Brooklyn and extending their winning streak to four games. The Nets, led by Trendon Watford's season-high 26 points, closed a 20-point deficit to come within one point, but Siakam's late surge clinched the game for Indiana. Brooklyn, struggling with their form, lost their third consecutive game, highlighting a season of difficulty with 13 losses in their last 15 games. The Pacers boasted an efficient performance with 32 assists on 40 baskets and a 21-8 advantage in fast-break points, maintaining their position for a potential playoff series with home-court advantage.

The Atlanta Hawks secured a 124-115 victory over the Golden State Warriors, with Trae Young leading the charge, recording his 41st double-double of the season with 25 points and 10 assists.

The Warriors, despite missing Curry, saw efforts from Jimmy Butler and Moses Moody, scoring 25 and 20 points respectively, while Brandin Podziemski added 19 points with a 63% shooting from three-point range.

**New York Knicks 122 - 103 Washington Wizards**  
Karl-Anthony Towns led the New York Knicks to a 122-103 victory over the Washington Wizards, tallying 31 points and 11 rebounds, while Mikal Bridges contributed 27 points. Despite the Knicks' commanding lead of 82-51 late in the third quarter, the Wizards mounted a surprising rally, reducing their deficit to 92-88 early in the fourth quarter. However, the Knicks responded decisively with a 9-0 run, reclaiming control and securing the win, ending a two-game losing streak for New York. The Wizards, who have the worst record in the NBA, struggled with their shooting, hitting only 1 of 10 three-pointers in the first quarter, and ultimately fell to their fourth consecutive defeat. Rookie Tyler Kolek, usually not utilized much, made a notable contribution with a career-high eight assists, reinforcing the Knicks' strong performance. The game highlighted Cam Payne's effective start as he filled in for the injured Deuce McBride and Jalen Brunson, while Marcus Smart and Jordan Poole were standout performers for the Wizards.

Josh Giddey nearly achieved a quadruple-double with 15 points, 17 assists, 10 rebounds, and eight steals, while Matas Buzelis added 31 points. Despite Luka Doncic's 34 points, including eight 3-pointers, the Lakers struggled defensively, allowing more points than they have in any game this season.

Meanwhile, the Lakers faced challenges with James returning from a groin injury, needing time to regain their form. The Bulls conclude their trip in Denver, while the Lakers head to Orlando to start a road trip.
