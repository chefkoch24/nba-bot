**Utah Jazz 115 - 113 Dallas Mavericks**  
The Utah Jazz secured their first home win of the season with a thrilling 115-113 victory over the Dallas Mavericks, highlighted by John Collins' decisive dunk with 6.4 seconds remaining. Collins had a standout performance, contributing 28 points and nine rebounds, while Jordan Clarkson added 20 points. Despite Luka Doncic's impressive 37-point, seven-rebound, and nine-assist effort, the Mavericks fell short without Kyrie Irving, who missed the game due to a shoulder sprain. Quentin Grimes, stepping in for Irving, scored 15 points. The Mavericks led at halftime, but Utah surged ahead with a 9-0 run in the third quarter, featuring key plays from Collins and Lauri Markkanen. Dallas tied the game late on Klay Thompsonâ€™s three-pointer, but Collins' timely dunk secured the Jazz's victory. Notably, rookie Kyle Filipowski is emerging as a reliable scorer for the Jazz, averaging 16.0 points on 68.4% shooting over his last two games. The Jazz capitalized on their fast-break opportunities, scoring 20 points in transition, and will next face the Sacramento Kings.
