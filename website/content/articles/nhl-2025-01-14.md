**Philadelphia Flyers 4 - 3 Florida Panthers**  
Noah Cates scored twice, including the definitive game-winner in the third period, as the Philadelphia Flyers rallied from a 2-0 deficit to beat the Florida Panthers 4-3 at Wells Fargo Center. This victory marked the Flyers' first consecutive win streak since mid-December, following their 6-0 triumph over the Anaheim Ducks. Florida, who previously held a perfect 16-0-0 record when leading after two periods this season, faltered despite two goals from Sam Reinhart, who notched his second straight multi-goal game. Catesâ€™ late-game heroics made him just the fourth Flyers player in two decades to tie and then secure a lead with both his goals in the third period. His performance, supported by Morgan Frost's goal during a power play and a stalwart defense from goalie Samuel Ersson, showcased Philadelphia's resilience. The Flyers also achieved consecutive games with multiple power-play goals for the first time since February 2019. Meanwhile, concerns arose for Florida as coach Paul Maurice criticized the team for losing momentum and playing into the Flyers' strategy.

**Chicago Blackhawks 2 - 5 Calgary Flames**  
Jakob Pelletier's standout three-point performance propelled the Calgary Flames to a 5-2 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks, marking their third consecutive win. Pelletier scored two goals and assisted once, with Yegor Sharangovich also contributing a short-handed goal and an assist. Rookie Rory Kerins impressed with two assists in his NHL debut, joining a select group of Flames players who've achieved multiple assists in their first game. Calgary's victory was bolstered by Dustin Wolf's 23 saves, while Connor Bedard's goal for Chicago marked his 100th NHL point, making him the quickest teenager to reach this milestone since Sidney Crosby. Despite Bedard's achievement, the Blackhawks suffered their third straight loss, with constructive criticism from interim coach Anders Sorensen implying a need for a collective effort to improve the team's performance.

**Edmonton Oilers 1 - 0 Los Angeles Kings**  
McDavid scores lone goal, Oilers blank Kings
 **EDMONTON** \-\- <forge-entity title="Connor McDavid" slug="connor-mcdavid-8478402" code="player">Connor McDavid</forge-entity> scored the only goal on his 28th birthday, and Stuart Skinner made 31 saves for the Edmonton Oilers in a 1-0 win against the Los Angeles Kings at Rogers Place on Monday. 
Skinner's shutout was his second of the season. His first came less than a week ago in a 4-0 win at the Boston Bruins on Jan. 7.

Leon Draisaitl and Darnell Nurse had an assist for the Oilers (27-13-3), who have won six of seven.

Darcy Kuemper made 29 saves for the Kings (24-12-5), who have lost two straight after winning their previous five.

The Kings had a chance to take the early lead at 4:52 of the first period. Anze Kopitar skated in on a 2-on-1 and sent a pass to Adrian Kempe, whose one-timer from the right circle was stopped by the outstretched glove of Skinner before deflecting up and landing on top of the net.

McDavid put the Oilers ahead 1-0 during a 4-on-4 at 18:37 of the second period. Draisaitl outmuscled Kings forward Trevor Moore for a loose puck, skated around the net, and sent a pass out to Nurse for a one-timer in the high slot. Although Kuemper made the initial save, the rebound went right to McDavid, who buried the puck from below the right circle.
