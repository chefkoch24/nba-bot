**Los Angeles Rams 15 - 23 Miami Dolphins**  
The Miami Dolphins snapped their three-game losing streak with a gritty 23-15 win over the Los Angeles Rams on Monday Night Football, despite enduring a season filled with challenges. Tyreek Hill's key third-quarter touchdown catch from Tua Tagovailoa, which ended Hillâ€™s longest scoring drought, and Jason Sanders' three field goals were instrumental in Miami's victory. Rookie Malik Washington also scored his first NFL touchdown, highlighting a turnaround performance by the Dolphins, whose defense excelled by forcing turnovers and preventing the Rams from scoring a touchdown. Tua Tagovailoa, contributing crucial plays, completed 9 of 12 third-down passes for 137 yards, while playing with resilience amidst external criticism. Los Angeles struggled offensively, failing to score a touchdown for the first time since November 2023, despite Matthew Stafford's 293 passing yards. The Rams' defeat ended their three-game winning streak and demonstrated a major offensive regression. Miami's win was significant not only for breaking their skid but also for preventing a winless weekend for all Florida-based NFL and college teams.
