**Denver Nuggets 101 - 115 Houston Rockets**  
In a decisive victory, the Houston Rockets defeated the Denver Nuggets 115-101, with Kevin Durant scoring 31 points and Reed Sheppard delivering a crucial 11-point surge at the end of the third quarter. Sheppard's performance included hitting 6 of 9 from beyond the arc, finishing with 28 points and helping extend the Rockets' lead when it mattered most. Despite the Nuggets narrowing a previous 21-point gap to just 10, Sheppard's timely 3-pointers and free throws kept Denver at bay and ended their six-game winning streak. The Rockets' 54% 3-point shooting accuracy, alongside contributions from Jabari Smith and Josh Okogie, proved too much for Denver, who shot just 27% from long range. Nikola Jokic led Denver with 25 points, but the team struggled without defender Peyton Watson and saw coach Dave Adelman ejected after disputing officiating. This win came after Rockets coach Ime Udoka was fined earlier in the week following criticism of officiating in their overtime loss to Denver.

The game saw standout performances from Dallas' rookies Cooper Flagg and Anthony Davis, who both scored 24 points, with Flagg dazzling the crowd with skillful plays and a noteworthy coast-to-coast layup.

This marked Embiid’s 16th missed game of the season, while Davis and Klay Thompson played for Dallas despite their previous uncertain statuses.

**Toronto Raptors 96 - 112 Boston Celtics**  
In a commanding performance, Payton Pritchard led the short-handed Boston Celtics to a 112-96 victory over the struggling Toronto Raptors, scoring 33 points and matching his season-high with 10 assists. Pritchard was particularly dominant in the third quarter, contributing 19 points and shooting 13 for 24 overall, including four 3-pointers. Despite missing Jaylen Brown due to illness, the Celtics saw strong support from Derrick White and Anfernee Simons, each with 15 points, while Neemias Queta added 14. The Raptors, breaking a two-game winning streak, struggled with key players like Immanuel Quickley and Ochai Agbaji combining for only nine points. Despite setting a season-high with 47 three-point attempts and sinking 16, it was insufficient as Toronto has now lost seven of their last ten games. The Celtics, who have won seven of their last nine encounters, continue their momentum as they prepare to host Indiana next.

In an impressive performance, Zion Williamson scored a season-high 29 points off the bench to lead the New Orleans Pelicans to a 128-109 victory over the Indiana Pacers, marking the Pelicans' fourth consecutive win.

He finished the game hitting 9 of 14 shots and 11 of 13 from the free-throw line, along with seven rebounds. The Pelicans' reserves contributed significantly with 66 points, a season high for the team. New Orleans achieved their best opening quarter of the season with 44 points, shooting a stunning 61%.

In a dominant performance, Cade Cunningham secured a triple-double with 22 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists as the Detroit Pistons cruised to a 112-86 victory over the Charlotte Hornets. Supporting Cunningham, Jalen Duren contributed 19 points and 11 rebounds, and Tobias Harris also added 19 points, making it a balanced attack with all five Pistons starters scoring in double figures. Despite Detroit's poor 21.4% shooting from beyond the arc, their strong finish and a rebounding edge of 62-41 helped them outpace Charlotte. Duncan Robinson's pivotal four-point play in the third quarter highlighted the game, while Charlotte's effort was hindered by LaMelo Ball fouling out after a tough night, scoring only eight points. The Hornets mounted a brief comeback but couldn't overcome the Pistons' late surge, as Detroit extended their record to winning seven of their last nine games.

**Memphis Grizzlies 122 - 130 Washington Wizards**  
In a thrilling comeback, the Washington Wizards overcame a 20-point deficit to defeat the Memphis Grizzlies 130-122, ending their seven-game losing streak in Memphis, where they hadn’t won since January 5, 2018. Key performances from CJ McCollum and Kyshawn George, who each scored 28 points, sparked the Wizards' second-half rally. Alex Sarr contributed with 18 points and 11 rebounds, including a crucial 3-pointer that gave Washington the lead with just over two minutes remaining. Despite Santi Aldama's career-high 37 points and Jaren Jackson Jr.'s 22 for Memphis, the Grizzlies, hampered by injuries and foul troubles, couldn't hold off Washington's charge. The game was tied at 115 with 4:31 left, but the Wizards shot 63% in the pivotal third quarter, outscoring the Grizzlies 42-27 to erase Memphis' lead and set up the exciting finish.

**Golden State Warriors 119 - 116 Phoenix Suns**  
The Golden State Warriors ended their three-game losing streak with a narrow 119-116 victory over the Phoenix Suns, led by Stephen Curry's 28 points, nine rebounds, and six assists, along with Jimmy Butler's 25 points. The game was marked by a tense fourth quarter, with Curry scoring 14 points and sealing the win after crucial exchanges, including a two-point conversion in the final seconds. Devin Booker shone for the Suns with 38 points, despite the team's hot 70.8% shooting start not being enough to secure a win. The matchup was heated, seeing Draymond Green ejected for technical fouls early and Dillon Brooks, who was booed throughout, committing a hard foul on Curry in a previous face-off. Green's ejection came after a confrontation involving a shove on Collin Gillespie, leading to more technical issues for the Warriors, with even coach Steve Kerr receiving one for protesting. The game was part of a contentious back-to-back series against the Suns and highlighted by the end of Buddy Hield's 199-game streak, while Jonathan Kuminga missed the game due to illness. The Suns will host the Lakers on Tuesday, while the Warriors face Orlando on Monday.

**Utah Jazz 127 - 128 Orlando Magic**  
In a challenging game against the Los Angeles Lakers, the Utah Jazz experienced yet another defensive lapse, leading to a 143-135 defeat, despite holding a lead for most of the first three quarters. Utah's standout shooter Keyonte George continued his impressive form with a third consecutive 30-point game, scoring 34 points and providing eight assists in the absence of leading scorer Lauri Markkanen. Meanwhile, the Lakers' Luka Doncic shined with a triple-double, posting 45 points, 14 assists, 11 rebounds, and five steals, showcasing his ability to take over in critical moments. The Jazz's coach, Will Hardy, praised George's hard work and influence, highlighting a ripple effect of inspiration among teammates, exemplified by Isaiah Collier's 18-point and 13-assist performance. As Utah faces the Orlando Magic, both teams are aiming to recover from recent slumps, with Utah losing three out of their last five games and Orlando, following a loss to Denver, having dropped four of their last six. Despite Paolo Banchero's efforts, including a triple-double against the Nuggets, the Magic struggled with a significant run by Denver, setting the stage for a pivotal matchup in Salt Lake City.

**LA Clippers 103 - 88 Los Angeles Lakers**  
Kawhi Leonard led the Los Angeles Clippers with 32 points in a matchup against the Los Angeles Lakers, as both teams prepared to face off in a Clippers home game in Inglewood, California. The Lakers, rejuvenated with an 11-3 record since November 14, have been in high spirits as they compete among the top teams in the Western Conference, especially since LeBron James's successful return from sciatica. Meanwhile, the Clippers have struggled, enduring an eight-game home losing streak and managing only one victory in the 11 games since Leonard's return from injuries. The Lakers recently showcased their offensive power with a season-high 143 points against the Utah Jazz, where Luka Doncic recorded his third triple-double of the season and LeBron James narrowly missed his own. Despite a challenging season, the Clippers continue to press forward with James Harden expected to return to the lineup, aiming to bounce back from previous defeats, including the 122-101 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder. The Lakers hold a recent advantage over the Clippers with a four-game winning streak as part of a 7-2 edge in their last nine meetings, marking a notable shift after the Clippers had previously dominated their cross-town rivalry.
