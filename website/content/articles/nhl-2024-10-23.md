**Philadelphia Flyers 1 - 4 Washington Capitals**  
The Washington Capitals secured their fourth consecutive victory with a 4-1 win over the Philadelphia Flyers, highlighted by Nic Dowd and Andrew Mangiapane scoring short-handed goals in the first period, marking Washington's first multiple short-handed goal game since 2006. John Carlson and Jakob Chychrun also contributed goals, with Connor McMichael providing two assists. Capitals' goalie Charlie Lindgren made 17 saves, boosting the team's defense, particularly during penalty kills. Despite Travis Sanheim opening the third period with a goal for the Flyers, the Capitals swiftly responded with Carlson's goal and Chychrun's clincher. The Flyers are struggling, losing five straight games with only one goal in their last two, sparking frustration as noted by coach John Tortorella. Mangiapane, adjusting to his new team after being traded, played a versatile role, sparking chemistry with linemates and aiding in stabilizing his line. The Flyers, with limited shots in the later periods, will seek to rebound against the Capitals in their next matchup.

**Florida Panthers 1 - 5 Minnesota Wild**  
In a commanding 5-1 victory over the Florida Panthers, the Minnesota Wild extended their point streak to six games, making them only the second team in NHL history to remain unbeaten in regulation for the first six games of the season, following the 1969-70 Boston Bruins. Matt Boldy, Joel Eriksson Ek, and Mats Zuccarello each contributed a goal and an assist, with Jake Middleton also adding three assists. Minnesota's win was underscored by a strong defensive performance, highlighted by goalie Filip Gustavsson's 24 saves, and a disciplined game with no penalties. The Panthers, who saw their four-game point streak end, struggled defensively, allowing five goals, resulting in goalie Sergei Bobrovsky being replaced after the second period. Notably, Matt Tkachuk returned for the Panthers and reached his 200th point with the team, while Mats Zuccarello achieved his 200th assist with the Wild.

**New Jersey Devils 5 - 8 Tampa Bay Lightning**  
In a high-scoring affair at the Prudential Center, the Tampa Bay Lightning overcame the New Jersey Devils 8-5, powered by Brandon Hagel's natural hat trick in the second period. This marked Hagel's third NHL hat trick and notably his second against New Jersey. The Lightning's conquer extended with standout performances from Victor Hedman, who netted two goals, and Anthony Cirelli, who delivered four assists. Jake Guentzel and Janis Moser also contributed significantly with a combined three goals and three assists. Despite Timo Meier's two goals and Jack Hughes's goal and two assists for New Jersey, the Devils could not match the Lightning’s offensive push. Tampa Bay's dominance continued as they maintained an impressive record against the Devils, not allowing New Jersey a victory in their last nine encounters, including five consecutive wins at the Devils' home arena. Interestingly, this game marked the first time New Jersey allowed eight goals at home since a match against the Montreal Canadiens in 1992, while Lightning's Nikita Kucherov extended his season-opening point streak to six games.

**Buffalo Sabres 4 - 2 Dallas Stars**  
The Buffalo Sabres secured a 4-2 victory over the Dallas Stars at KeyBank Center, with Ryan McLeod scoring in his fourth consecutive game. Owen Power stood out with three assists, while Tage Thompson and Alex Tuch each contributed a goal and an assist, aiding the Sabres to their second straight win despite a modest 3-4-1 record. Goaltender Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen made 28 crucial saves. The Stars struggled, particularly on the power play, going 0-for-3, and remain just 2-for-21 with the man advantage this season. Thomas Harley and Tyler Seguin, who returned from an injury, scored for Dallas, but it wasn't enough to overcome Buffalo's energized play, which was bolstered by Peyton Krebs' opening goal. The Stars' coach, Pete DeBoer, noted Buffalo's superior execution and hunger in the game.

**Montreal Canadiens 2 - 7 New York Rangers**  
The New York Rangers dominated the Montreal Canadiens with a decisive 7-2 victory at Bell Centre, marking their fourth consecutive win and setting a franchise record for the longest season-opening point streak at 5-0-1. The Rangers erupted with four goals in the first 11 minutes, with Filip Chytil leading the charge with two goals and an assist, while Kaapo Kakko contributed a goal and two assists. Igor Shesterkin made 21 saves, solidifying New York's defensive front. Despite Nick Suzuki's efforts with two goals for the Canadiens, Montreal couldn't recover from the early onslaught. The Rangers' impressive feat of scoring at least four goals in each of their first six games marks a historical note in franchise history, a record only bested by the Florida Panthers in the past 30 years. Rangers coach Peter Laviolette praised the comprehensive team effort, highlighting the balanced contributions across all lines. Ryan Lindgren made a notable return from injury, adding defensive depth in his season debut.

**Columbus Blue Jackets 6 - 2 Toronto Maple Leafs**  
In an assertive performance, the Columbus Blue Jackets triumphed 6-2 over the Toronto Maple Leafs, spurred by Mathieu Olivier's first career two-goal NHL game and strong contributions from Justin Danforth, Sean Monahan, and Kirill Marchenko. Danforth, with a goal and two assists, and Monahan and Marchenko, each with a goal and an assist, highlighted the Blue Jackets' balanced offensive display. Columbus seized an early lead, with James van Riemsdyk initiating the scoring less than six minutes into the game, and never relented, building the lead to 5-0 by the middle of the second period. The Maple Leafs, coming off a win against the Tampa Bay Lightning just the night before, struggled as their usual defensive rigor faltered, with coach Craig Berube noting that his team was consistently outworked. Columbus capitalized on Toronto's fatigue and defensive lapses, effectively controlling the neutral zone to cruise to victory. Despite goals from Matthew Knies and Nicholas Robertson, Toronto's Auston Matthews’ streak of scoring in nine consecutive games versus Columbus came to an end, and Max Pacioretty's exit due to injury further compounded the Leafs' frustration.

**New York Islanders 0 - 1 Detroit Red Wings**  
Lyon makes 30 saves, Red Wings shut out Islanders
 **ELMONT, N.Y. --** <forge-entity title="Alex Lyon" slug="alex-lyon-8479312" code="player">Alex Lyon</forge-entity> made 30 saves for the Detroit Red Wings in a 1-0 win against the New York Islanders at UBS Arena on Tuesday. 
It was Lyon's first shutout this season and his fourth in the NHL.

“I’m always nervous, but generally, you don’t know if it’s going to be a good night, but generally, you know if it’s going to be a bad night, so that’s a bit more stressful,” Lyon said. “I wasn’t coming into the game feeling like, ‘Oh, I’m feeling it,’ or anything like that. ... I thought we did a really good job keeping them to the perimeter.”

<forge-entity title="Patrick Kane" slug="patrick-kane-8474141" code="player">Patrick Kane</forge-entity> scored his first goal of the season for the Red Wings (3-3-0), who have won two straight.

“There's going to be nights throughout your season that you're not going to have your legs, and I knew early on we didn't,” Detroit coach Derek Lalonde said. "I tried to manage it. I thought we at least managed the puck a little bit better. In the first period, we didn't manage the puck at all. But for the most part, it's a really good defensive effort. I think the lack of legs showed up on the offensive side of things, but it didn't on the defensive side of things.” 
<forge-entity title="Ilya Sorokin" slug="ilya-sorokin-8478009" code="player">Ilya Sorokin</forge-entity> made 10 saves for the Islanders (2-2-2), who were shut out for the third time this season.

New York also lost 1-0 in overtime to the St. Louis Blues on Thursday.

“That’s not the result we wanted, our fans as well,” Islanders coach Patrick Roy said. “But at the end of the night, it was 30-\[11\] shots on net. I don't know how many chances against. We dominated in every department of the game, so the only thing I wish we could have done better is get in front of the net for the screens and keep making the goalie not see those shots.”

The Red Wings scored on their first shot of the game to take a 1-0 lead at 8:54 of the first period. <forge-entity title="Vladimir Tarasenko" slug="vladimir-tarasenko-8475765" code="player">Vladimir Tarasenko</forge-entity> skated down the left wing before passing back to Kane, who buried a one-timer glove side from the bottom of the circle.

“We talk about trying to fill that slot and trying to find that area. I thought they covered it pretty well,” Kane said. “Actually, it was just kind of a perfect timing play. I was covered and then as soon as he passed it, I found some open ice. They even got a stick on me when I shot it, but sometimes you find those open areas.” 
<forge-entity title="Brock Nelson" slug="brock-nelson-8475754" code="player">Brock Nelson</forge-entity> had a chance to tie it for the Islanders at 12:10 of the second period, but his shot on the power play hit off the crossbar.

The Islanders finished the game 0-for-3 on the power play, including failing to get a shot on net after <forge-entity title="Erik Gustafsson" slug="erik-gustafsson-8476979" code="player">Erik Gustafsson</forge-entity> was called for interference with 5:29 remaining in the third period.

“I thought tonight we moved it pretty good on the power play,” New York defenseman <forge-entity title="Noah Dobson" slug="noah-dobson-8480865" code="player">Noah Dobson</forge-entity> said. “We had the looks but just didn't capitalize. So, we have to find a way to capitalize on those chances. Those are big opportunities where we can change the game.”

**NOTE:** The 11 shots against were the fewest the Islanders have allowed in a loss since Oct. 8, 2007, when they allowed 12 shots on goal in a 2-1 loss to the Washington Capitals.

**St Louis Blues 2 - 3 Winnipeg Jets**  
The Winnipeg Jets remained unbeaten by clinching their sixth consecutive victory, defeating the St. Louis Blues 3-2 at the Enterprise Center. Kyle Connor scored for the fourth game in a row, while Cole Perfetti provided three assists and Connor Hellebuyck made 27 saves for the Jets, who continue their impressive season-opening run. Brandon Saad tallied his 500th NHL point with two goals for the Blues, supported by two assists from Robert Thomas. Despite a late effort from Blues captain Brayden Schenn, who missed a chance to tie the game with 43 seconds left, the Jets held on for the win. The game also marked the end of Blues defenseman Philip Broberg's six-game point streak and saw Robert Thomas exit with a lower-body injury after blocking a shot.

**Chicago Blackhawks 3 - 6 Vancouver Canucks**  
In a dynamic matchup, J.T. Miller led the Vancouver Canucks with a goal and two assists, propelling them to a 6-3 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks at the United Center. Despite previously being uncertain to play due to an injury, Miller's performance, including scoring on a power play, was pivotal. Danton Heinen also shined, netting his first two goals for the Canucks, who wrapped up a successful road trip with this victory. Conor Garland contributed a goal and an assist, while Quinn Hughes and Kiefer Sherwood added two assists each. The Canucks' scoring depth was evident, earning praise from coach Rich Tocchet. On the Blackhawks' side, Taylor Hall reached a career milestone with his 700th NHL point, but Chicago struggled defensively, conceding early and often, which affected their game rhythm. Kevin Lankinen maintained his impressive start for Vancouver between the posts with 31 saves, extending his point streak to four games in his Canucks debut season.

 **NASHVILLE --** <forge-entity title="Juuse Saros" slug="juuse-saros-8477424" code="player">Juuse Saros</forge-entity> made 33 saves, and the Nashville Predators ended a five-game skid with their first win of the season, 4-0 against the Boston Bruins at Bridgestone Arena on Tuesday. 
It was Saros’ first shutout of the season, and 24th in the NHL.

“It feels very good,” O’Reilly said. “I thought just as a group, as a whole, our intensity was much better. Again, not a perfect game. Still made mistakes, but just the way we kept fighting, we were stronger on battles and talking more. And yeah, we found a way to do it. That’s a great lesson for us, kind of that feeling out there and that intensity is what we have to keep bringing. That’s how we’re going to get out of this hole.” 
<forge-entity title="Jeremy Swayman" slug="jeremy-swayman-8480280" code="player">Jeremy Swayman</forge-entity> made 38 saves for the Bruins (3-3-1), who finished 1-1-1 on their three-game road trip.

It’s hard to win in this league. We played a really desperate team today. They came out, they played hard. They generated chances. They scored on their chances. We didn’t. That was the difference in the game.”

O’Reilly gave Nashville a 1-0 lead at 17:16 of the first period with a power-play goal on a redirection of a shot by Josi.

“You go through a \[losing streak\] like this, you’ve got to celebrate \[a win\] a little bit and enjoy it,” Predators coach Andrew Brunette said. “It was well-deserved. I think we were squeezing our sticks and feeling a little bit of the heat, and it could’ve \[gone\] two different ways. I think today they stayed positive, they encouraged each other, and they helped each other get out of it a little bit here for one game.” 
<forge-entity title="Tommy Novak" slug="tommy-novak-8478438" code="player">Tommy Novak</forge-entity> extended it to 2-0 at 16:55 of the second period on a rebound of a backhand attempt on net from Evangelista. The goal came just after a four-minute power play had expired for Nashville.

“Looked a lot better,” Nyquist said. “Obviously there’s still stuff we can be better at, but a very big step in the right direction at least. But again, we’ve got to keep building. Obviously, this is just one game. We’ve dug ourselves a little hole here in the beginning, so back at it on Friday.”

Evangelista scored an empty-net goal at 13:56 for the 4-0 final.

“Just to keep working,” Bruins coach Jim Montgomery said of his message to the team after the game. “We cannot beat ourselves. It’s a long season. We’ve got to keep grinding. We’ve got to get better and better every day.”

**NOTES:** Bruins forward Max Jones came into the lineup in place of <forge-entity title="Justin Brazeau" slug="justin-brazeau-8479638" code="player">Justin Brazeau</forge-entity>.

Senators score 4 in 1st, shut out Utah Hockey Club
 **SALT LAKE CITY --** The Ottawa Senators scored four goals in an 8:09 span in the first period in a 4-0 win against the Utah Hockey Club at Delta Center on Tuesday. 
<forge-entity title="Brady Tkachuk" slug="brady-tkachuk-8480801" code="player">Brady Tkachuk</forge-entity> scored for the third straight game, and <forge-entity title="Nick Jensen" slug="nick-jensen-8475324" code="player">Nick Jensen</forge-entity> had two assists for the Senators (4-2-0), who have won three of four. <forge-entity title="Anton Forsberg" slug="anton-forsberg-8476341" code="player">Anton Forsberg</forge-entity> made 31 saves for his sixth NHL shutout.

“I thought the first period was almost a tale of two periods,” Ottawa coach Travis Green said. “\[It\] took us probably ten minutes to get our legs under us to catch up to the speed of the game. They’ve got a very fast team, and I felt like we were a little on our heels a little bit early and \[Forsberg\] kept us in it.” 
<forge-entity title="Connor Ingram" slug="connor-ingram-8478971" code="player">Connor Ingram</forge-entity> allowed four goals on nine shots for Utah (4-2-1), which has lost three of four. <forge-entity title="Karel Vejmelka" slug="karel-vejmelka-8478872" code="player">Karel Vejmelka</forge-entity> replaced him to begin the second period and stopped all 14 shots he faced.

“A couple of mistakes cost us,” Utah captain <forge-entity title="Clayton Keller" slug="clayton-keller-8479343" code="player">Clayton Keller</forge-entity> said. “They played well, they made it hard on us. It’s something we’ll learn from ... and next time we’ll know what to expect.”

Utah controlled the first ten minutes of the first period, outshooting Ottawa 8-1.

“We had them where we wanted. We played well,” Utah coach Andre Tourigny said. “We just need to stay patient, stay humble, go one shift at a time. We got ahead of ourselves and we paid for it.” 
<forge-entity title="Drake Batherson" slug="drake-batherson-8480208" code="player">Drake Batherson</forge-entity> gave Ottawa a 1-0 lead during a 4-on-4 at 11:43 of the first. He scored from the bottom of the left circle off a cross-seam pass from <forge-entity title="Josh Norris" slug="josh-norris-8480064" code="player">Josh Norris</forge-entity>.

“They came out hard, obviously,” Forsberg said. “They got a few chances there from the start. Sometimes when it goes your way it's a lot easier because you get into it without thinking much. So, it was good, and it kind of rolled on from that.”

<forge-entity title="Claude Giroux" slug="claude-giroux-8473512" code="player">Claude Giroux</forge-entity> made it 2-0 during the same 4-on-4 at 13:06. Jensen intercepted a pass in the neutral zone and skated in on a 2-on-1 before passing to Giroux, who kicked the puck to his stick and chipped a shot over Ingram's glove.

“It's fun hockey. I'm sure the fans love it,” Giroux said. “We're confident in our 5-on-5, but we were able to get two goals there (at 4-on-4), so that was huge.” 
<forge-entity title="Ridly Greig" slug="ridly-greig-8482092" code="player">Ridly Greig</forge-entity>, who missed the previous three games with an upper-body injury, scored his first of the season on the power play at 18:05 to extend the lead to 3-0.

**Anaheim Ducks 3 - 1 San Jose Sharks**  
The Anaheim Ducks snapped a two-game losing streak by defeating the San Jose Sharks 3-1 at Honda Center, largely thanks to their first two power-play goals of the season, scored by Troy Terry and Leo Carlsson. Prior to Terry's second-period goal, the Ducks had been 0-for-20 with the man advantage. Carlsson scored the go-ahead goal shortly after the Sharks tied the game in the third period, and Alex Killorn secured the win with an empty-netter. Anaheim's Cutter Gauthier provided two assists, marking his first multipoint NHL game. Lukas Dostal made 27 saves, including stopping two near-goals for San Jose in a game that saw the Sharks unable to break their 0-5-2 start to the season. Despite valiant efforts from Mackenzie Blackwood with 37 saves and Mikael Granlund scoring San Jose's sole goal, the Sharks' struggles continued, adding to their seventh consecutive loss.

**Seattle Kraken 2 - 3 Colorado Avalanche**  
The Colorado Avalanche secured a 3-2 victory against the Seattle Kraken, earning their third consecutive win, with Nathan MacKinnon and Cale Makar extending their season-opening point streaks to seven games. Joel Kiviranta scored twice, continuing his impressive form with his third goal in two games. MacKinnon tallied a power-play goal, and Makar contributed two assists, making them indispensable for the team due to a depleted lineup. Justus Annunen, in his second NHL start, made 25 saves. Despite Jared McCann's 100th career goal with the Kraken and Ryker Evans scoring late in the game, Seattle fell short as their three-game win streak was snapped. MacKinnon and Makar are notable as the only NHL players this season with a seven-game point streak, and Makar joined John-Michael Liles as the only defensemen in franchise history to achieve such a feat.

Mark Stone added a goal and two assists, while Alex Pietrangelo assisted three times, aiding Vegas's overall performance. Despite Warren Foegele's goal for the Kings, the team's struggles were evident, particularly on penalty kills, which was a decisive factor, as noted by Hertl after the game.
