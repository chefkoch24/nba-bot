**Seattle Kraken 2 - 3 St Louis Blues**  
In an exciting season opener at Climate Pledge Arena, the St. Louis Blues rallied from a two-goal deficit to defeat the Seattle Kraken 3-2, thanks to two goals from Jordan Kyrou and a debut goal by Philip Broberg. The game marked the debut of Dan Bylsma as Kraken head coach and saw Seattle captain Jordan Eberle officially named before the game. Notably, Kraken assistant coach Jessica Campbell made history as the first woman to coach an NHL regular-season game. Though Vince Dunn and Eeli Tolvanen initially put Seattle ahead, the Blues' turnaround came in a swift 1:55 span during the second period, with Kyrou also managing a crucial power-play goal following an overturned Seattle goal. Justin Faulk contributed two assists, while Jordan Binnington made 30 saves to secure the Bluesâ€™ sixth straight opener without a loss.

**Florida Panthers 6 - 4 Boston Bruins**  
In their Stanley Cup title defense opener, the Florida Panthers dominated early by scoring four goals in the first period, ultimately securing a 6-4 victory against the Boston Bruins at Amerant Bank Arena. This energetic start was fueled by Sam Bennett's double goal contribution, alongside goals from Sam Reinhart and Evan Rodrigues, while goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky made 24 saves. Coach Paul Maurice attributed the team's vibrant performance to the energy from raising the championship banner and an electrified home crowd. Meanwhile, the Bruins couldn't quite catch up despite goals from Charlie McAvoy, David Pastrnak, Pavel Zacha, and Trent Frederic. Joonas Korpisalo struggled in his Bruins debut, allowing six goals on 35 shots after being acquired in a trade, while Jeremy Swayman remained benched following his new contract. The game also saw Carter Verhaeghe sign a long-term contract extension with the Panthers, marking his commitment to the team.
