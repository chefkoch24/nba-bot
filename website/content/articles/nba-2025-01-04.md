**Detroit Pistons 98 - 94 Charlotte Hornets**  
Tobias Harris led the Detroit Pistons to a hard-fought 98-94 victory over the Charlotte Hornets, recording 24 points and 10 rebounds, while Cade Cunningham and Jalen Duren contributed significantly with 18 points and 14 rebounds, respectively. Despite Charlotte's Miles Bridges scoring 20 points and Mark Williams adding 18, the Hornets faced their ninth consecutive defeat. The Pistons capitalized on Charlotte's poor shooting in the fourth quarter, where the Hornets made only 4 of 19 attempts and struggled with free throws, missing 11 of 30. Detroit overcame a halftime deficit of 65-52 by dominating the third quarter with a 32-17 run. Although the Pistons continued their fouling issues, committing 27 fouls to the Hornets' 10, Charlotte's inability to convert free throws was pivotal. This win marked Detroit's fifth in six games, as they adapted to Jaden Ivey's absence due to a broken leg, with Malik Beasley stepping up to score 12 points in extended minutes. As the Hornets continue their road trip against the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Pistons prepare to host the Timberwolves in a back-to-back series.

In a thrilling matchup, the Los Angeles Lakers are set to host the Atlanta Hawks, concluding LeBron James' first back-to-back games since he turned 40. James showcased his remarkable form with a 38-point performance, equalling Michael Jordan's record of 562 career 30-point games, during a 114-106 victory against the Portland Trail Blazers despite missing star teammate Anthony Davis, who is sidelined with a sprained ankle.
