The Knicks, now 20-8 overall and 14-2 at home, relied on strong performances from Brunson, Bridges, and Anunoby as Towns struggled. Kel’el Ware led Miami with 28 points and 19 rebounds in a game that saw the Heat falter, losing for the seventh time in eight games to fall to a 15-14 record. Despite a late Miami surge that cut the Knicks' lead to two, New York responded with an 8-0 run to secure the victory.

DiVincenzo's sharp shooting contributed 18 points, while Rudy Gobert recorded 11 points and 18 rebounds, marking his 10,000th career rebound.

**Sacramento Kings 125 - 124 Houston Rockets**  
The Houston Rockets continued their six-game road trip with a decisive 115-101 victory over the Denver Nuggets, rebounding from a previous 128-125 overtime loss to the same team earlier in the week. Coach Ime Udoka praised his squad for their high-level defense and three-point shooting, highlighting their 19-of-35 performance from beyond the arc. Kevin Durant was influential, scoring 31 points against Denver, while Reed Sheppard had an impressive showing off the bench with 28 points, tying his career high with six three-pointers. Jabari Smith Jr. also contributed significantly with 22 points and 10 rebounds. The victory came after a disappointing collapse against the New Orleans Pelicans, who matched a franchise record by erasing a 25-point deficit. As the Rockets prepare to face the struggling Sacramento Kings, who have lost five consecutive games and are missing key player Domantas Sabonis due to injury, they aim to build on their momentum. The Kings have been plagued by poor three-point shooting, notably Keegan Murray's ongoing struggles, as Sacramento looks to bounce back from near victories in recent games.
