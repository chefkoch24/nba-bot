In the decisive Game 7 of the NBA Finals, the Oklahoma City Thunder, led by their star player Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, are set to face off against the Indiana Pacers. The Thunder are eager to secure their first championship since relocating to Oklahoma City in 2008, while the Pacers aim for their inaugural NBA title, having previously captured three ABA championships. This marks the NBA's 20th Game 7 in Finals history, and the first since 2016. The Thunder boast a strong home record, going 10-2 in the playoffs, and have avoided consecutive losses during the postseason. Conversely, the Pacers enter the game with momentum following a Game 6 victory, despite Tyrese Haliburton playing through a calf strain.
