**Detroit Red Wings 2 - 5 Toronto Maple Leafs**  
In Todd McLellan's debut as the Detroit Red Wings coach, Mitch Marner’s natural hat trick led the Toronto Maple Leafs to a decisive 5-2 victory, halting their two-game losing streak. Despite early pressure from Detroit, Marner capitalized on strong assists from teammates John Tavares and William Nylander, completing his hat trick by the second period. McLellan, who replaced Derek Lalonde, acknowledged the areas Detroit needs to improve, notably their entry coverages and defensive-zone play, as the team suffered its fourth consecutive loss. David Kampf celebrated his 500th NHL game by scoring his season's first goal, while Toronto's goalie Joseph Woll successfully defended 23 shots. The Maple Leafs managed to protect their lead with effective slot coverage and blocked attempts, while Detroit's goalie swap in the third period could not alter the momentum. Despite goals from Lucas Raymond and Simon Edvinsson for Detroit, Toronto’s clinical passing and finishing, underscored by Marner’s effort, proved decisive. Notably absent was Auston Matthews, who remained out due to injury.

The Minnesota Wild pulled off a dramatic 3-2 victory over the Dallas Stars with Brock Faber scoring just 35 seconds into overtime, after rallying from a two-goal deficit. Faber's dynamic play, receiving a pass from Matt Boldy and executing a wraparound goal, highlighted his shiftiness and the synergy among the Wild's emerging talents, praised by Marcus Foligno post-game.
