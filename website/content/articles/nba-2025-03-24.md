The Detroit Pistons secured a 136-130 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans, buoyed by Ron Holland II's standout performance, where he scored 14 of his season-high 26 points in the decisive fourth quarter.

**LA Clippers 101 - 103 Oklahoma City Thunder**  
The Oklahoma City Thunder claimed their sixth consecutive victory by narrowly defeating the Los Angeles Clippers 103-101, despite the absence of key players Jalen Williams and Chet Holmgren. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder with 26 points and eight assists, while Aaron Wiggins contributed 19 points. The Thunder triumph was achieved even with Gilgeous-Alexander's uncharacteristically low shooting performance of 24.1% from the field. Alex Caruso made a crucial go-ahead three-pointer late in the game after Oklahoma City nearly relinquished a nine-point lead in the fourth quarter. The Clippers, with Kawhi Leonard and James Harden scoring 25 and 17 points respectively, saw their five-game winning streak end despite Leonard's double-double and head coach Tyronn Lue's return from a back issue. Harden's performance was marred by shooting struggles and a final attempt blunder that cost the Clippers their comeback chance. This victory marked the Thunder's season sweep of the Clippers, maintaining their standing atop the NBA.
