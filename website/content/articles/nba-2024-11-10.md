**LA Clippers 103 - 102 Toronto Raptors**  
In a matchup against his former team, Norman Powell shined as the Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Toronto Raptors 107-98 in Inglewood. Filling the scoring void left by the absent Kawhi Leonard and the departed Paul George, Powell has averaged a career-best 25.7 points per game this season, scoring 31 points against the Sacramento Kings on Friday to extend the Clippers' winning streak to three games. The Raptors, dealing with absences of several key players including Scottie Barnes and Kelly Olynyk, had led the Kings after three quarters in their prior game before collapsing in the fourth. Playing without standout newcomers RJ Barrett and Jonathan Mogbo, Toronto has faced early struggles on their road trip. Meanwhile, the Clippers have begun turning their New Arena into a stronghold, recovering from an initial losing streak with back-to-back wins over the Spurs and 76ers.
