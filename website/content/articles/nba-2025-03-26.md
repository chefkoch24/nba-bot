**Charlotte Hornets 104 - 111 Orlando Magic**  
In a closely contested game, the Orlando Magic triumphed over the Charlotte Hornets with a 111-104 victory, largely thanks to Paolo Banchero's continued hot streak, scoring 32 points alongside seven rebounds and six assists. This marked Banchero’s fourth consecutive game scoring at least 30, propelling the Magic to win five of their last seven games, and they managed to sweep Charlotte in all their matchups this season. Franz Wagner also contributed significantly with 26 points, hitting crucial free throws late in the game to seal the win. Despite a solid performance from LaMelo Ball, who recorded 25 points and nine assists, the Hornets were unable to avert another loss, their fifth in six games, which underscores their struggles after being ousted from playoff contention. The decisive moment came after Josh Green tied the game at 104, when Black's dunk and Wagner's consistent free-throw shooting ensured the victory for Orlando. Meanwhile, the Magic demonstrated discipline, committing only eight turnovers, and will next face the Dallas Mavericks, while the Hornets are set to meet the Toronto Raptors.

Portland's offensive efforts were led by Scoot Henderson and Shaedon Sharpe with 18 points each, though the team remains 3½ games behind Phoenix for a play-in tournament position in the Western Conference. Coach Kenny Atkinson of the Cavs downplayed the importance of focusing solely on playoff seeding, prioritizing team health instead. Meanwhile, Portland's Toumani Camara showcased improved 3-point shooting this season. Jerome's third-quarter surge helped keep Cleveland ahead, and the Cavs dominated in the paint with a 64-42 advantage.

**Sacramento Kings 105 - 121 Oklahoma City Thunder**  
The Oklahoma City Thunder secured their 60th win of the season with a 121-105 victory over the Sacramento Kings, led by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's 32-point performance. This triumph marked the Thunder's seventh consecutive win and their 14th in 15 games, maintaining their position as the NBA's leading team. Chet Holmgren contributed 18 points and 10 rebounds, and Alex Caruso added 15 points. Meanwhile, the Kings, who have now lost four straight games, were led by Keegan Murray's 28 points, including nine three-pointers, and Zach LaVine's 19 points. Despite a strong third-quarter rally, the Kings couldn't overcome a 24-point first-half deficit, ultimately falling to a dominant Oklahoma City in the fourth quarter. The Thunder became the first team to reach 60 wins this season, tying their 2012-13 team's achievement since the franchise's relocation from Seattle. As Sacramento sits tied with Phoenix for ninth place in the Western Conference, they risk missing the play-in tournament, with only a half-game lead over Dallas for the final spot.
