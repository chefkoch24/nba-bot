**Cincinnati Bengals 38 - 41 Baltimore Ravens**  
In a thrilling overtime contest, the Baltimore Ravens edged out the Cincinnati Bengals 41-38, thanks to a decisive 24-yard field goal by Justin Tucker, following Derrick Henry's crucial 51-yard run that positioned the Ravens deep in Bengals' territory. The game was a high-speed shootout, featuring over 700 yards of passing and nine touchdown passes. Lamar Jackson completed the day with 348 yards and four touchdowns, overcoming multiple 10-point deficits and a fourth-quarter fumble, while Joe Burrow delivered a career-high five touchdown passes, totaling 392 yards. Burrow’s standout pass was a 70-yard screen to Ja’Marr Chase, but it was the uncapitalized missed kick by Bengals' Evan McPherson in overtime that left Cincinnati's efforts unfulfilled. Despite Henry’s initial struggles, he shined in the final moments, setting up Baltimore's victory. Among the game’s setbacks, Bengals' Dax Hill and Amarius Mims suffered injuries, while the Ravens face the Washington Commanders next Sunday, and the Bengals visit the New York Giants.

Meanwhile, key injuries affected both teams, with Colts' right guard Will Fries suffering a broken leg and the Jaguars dealing with minor injuries to key players.

In a thrilling finish, the New York Giants secured a 29-20 win over the Seattle Seahawks with a late touchdown resulting from a blocked kick. Isaiah Simmons, added to the Giants' field goal block team, executed a diving block, allowing Bryce Ford-Wheaton to return the ball 60 yards for the decisive touchdown with less than a minute remaining. The Giants, overcoming the absence of key offensive players, controlled the game with Daniel Jones' efficient performance and a strong ground attack, highlighted by rookie Tyrone Tracy's 129 rushing yards. The Seahawks, although showing resilience with a late-game rally, struggled with ineffective rushing and protection for quarterback Geno Smith, who was sacked seven times. A notable blemish for New York was a goal-line fumble returned 102 yards for a touchdown by Seattle’s Rayshawn Jenkins. Despite injuries and penalties, the Giants' special teams play proved crucial in handing Seattle a loss, ahead of their next game against San Francisco.

**New England Patriots 10 - 15 Miami Dolphins**  
In a game marked by numerous mistakes and penalties, the Miami Dolphins narrowly defeated the New England Patriots 15-10 despite self-inflicted wounds including a blocked punt, two botched field goals, and a costly interception. Miami's Alec Ingold scored the game-winning touchdown on his only carry, completing a gritty 15-play drive. However, the Dolphins had to survive a late Patriots' challenge, including a reversed touchdown call that would've put New England ahead, and subsequent failed attempts to score as they mismanaged the clock. Quarterback Tyler Huntley, in his second start for Miami, threw 18 completions for 194 yards but also suffered an interception that set up the Patriots' only touchdown. Despite Brissett's efforts to rally New England, including a crucial pass to the Miami 11-yard line in the final seconds, the Patriots couldn't capitalize due to penalties and clock mismanagement. Both teams struggled with special teams errors, including a missed kick by Patriots' Joey Slye and multiple snaps issues by Miami. Injuries also played a role, with Miami's De’Von Achane and Jevon Holland leaving the game, while New England had to adjust to the absence of key players like David Andrews and Caedan Wallace.

In a decisive 34-18 victory, Pat Surtain II catalyzed the Denver Broncos' win over the Las Vegas Raiders with two crucial interceptions, including a game-changing 100-yard touchdown return that turned the tide from an early 10-0 deficit. This victory ended the Broncos' eight-game losing streak against the Raiders and showcased both the resilience of Denver's defense and the emerging talent of rookie quarterback Bo Nix, who threw for two touchdowns and ran for another. The game, which featured throwback festivities and a significant jersey swap with Hall of Famer Champ Bailey, was marked by a heated sideline exchange between Nix and Denver's coach Sean Payton. Despite the Raiders' strong start, injuries and turnovers, including two from quarterback Gardner Minshew, thwarted their momentum. The Broncos capitalized on opportunities provided by Denver's stout defense, which limited the Raiders to just 5 yards rushing after halftime. The victory continued the Broncos' recovery after a poor start to the season, hinting at growing strength and cohesion within the team.

**San Francisco 49ers 23 - 24 Arizona Cardinals**  
In an impressive comeback, the Arizona Cardinals edged past the San Francisco 49ers with a narrow 24-23 victory, thanks to a stellar performance by Kyler Murray. Murray ignited the game with a spectacular 50-yard touchdown run and later orchestrated a crucial late-game drive to position the Cardinals for a successful field goal by Chad Ryland. Despite the intense pressure, Ryland, newly signed due to Matt Prater's injury, delivered a 35-yard field goal with just over a minute left. The Cardinals' defense firmly held the 49ers at bay in the second half, forcing three turnovers, including a game-sealing interception by Kyzir White. Marvin Harrison Jr.'s critical fourth-down catch also highlighted Arizona's determined push in the final moments. This victory was a significant turnaround from the previous week's 28-point loss to Washington, marking the Cardinals' ability to execute under pressure and exploit the 49ers’ struggles in protecting late-game leads. San Francisco, on its second division loss this season, failed to hold onto a double-digit lead once more, marking a recurring issue under coach Kyle Shanahan.

However, the Vikings' rookie kicker Will Reichard sealed the win with a 41-yard field goal, his third of the game.

In a thrilling game, the Houston Texans narrowly defeated the Buffalo Bills 23-20, thanks to Ka'imi Fairbairn's 59-yard field goal as time expired. C.J. Stroud showcased his talent with 331 passing yards and a touchdown, though the team faced challenges after star receiver Nico Collins suffered a hamstring injury following his 67-yard touchdown catch. Stefon Diggs, playing against his former team for the first time since a major trade, led the Texans with 82 receiving yards and admitted the game's importance to him emotionally. Despite a strong start, leading 20-3, the Texans allowed the Bills to rally and tie the game. However, defensive plays, including a strip-sack of Stroud, and a final offensive drive aided by Dare Ogunbowale’s run, positioned Fairbairn to clinch the win. Meanwhile, Bills quarterback Josh Allen struggled, completing only 9 of 30 passes for 131 yards, marking the team's second consecutive loss after a promising start to the season.

In a commanding 36-10 victory over the Carolina Panthers, Caleb Williams and DJ Moore showcased their synergy, leading the Chicago Bears to their second consecutive win. Williams, the top draft pick, had a standout game, throwing for 304 yards and two touchdowns, both caught by Moore, who collected 105 receiving yards against his former team. Complementing Williams' aerial assault, D’Andre Swift contributed significantly with 120 all-purpose yards and a touchdown. The game also saw some drama with a brawl ensuing after Roschon Johnson's touchdown, leading to ejections. Despite Andy Dalton starting for Carolina, he struggled, completing only 18 of 28 passes for 136 yards and an interception. This win extended the Bears' impressive home streak to eight games, marking their longest such run since 2006, and was celebrated with a special moment honoring Chicago icon Derrick Rose on the videoboard.
