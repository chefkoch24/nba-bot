**Atlanta Hawks 123 - 122 Boston Celtics**  
Dejounte Murray scored a career-high 44 points and hit the game-winning shot in overtime as the Atlanta Hawks stunned the Boston Celtics with a 123-122 victory. The Celtics, who have already clinched the No. 1 seed in the East, couldn't handle Murray's scoring outburst, despite Jayson Tatum's 31-point performance. Atlanta has won four straight games, matching their longest streak of the season, and is fighting for a spot in the play-in tournament. The Hawks played without key players like Trae Young and still managed to pull off a thrilling win over the top team in the East.
