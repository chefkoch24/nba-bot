**Boston Celtics 107 - 105 Minnesota Timberwolves**  
In a thrilling game, the Boston Celtics held off the Minnesota Timberwolves with a 107-105 victory, thanks to Jaylen Brown's explosive start, scoring the team's first 15 points with five consecutive three-pointers, and finishing with 29 points. Jayson Tatum contributed 26 points and eight rebounds, helping Boston achieve a season-high fifth straight win. Despite Anthony Edwards' impressive 28 points and nine rebounds for Minnesota, and Rudy Gobert's strong performance with 10 points and 20 rebounds marking his eighth double-double of the season, the Timberwolves couldn't maintain their comeback efforts. Boston led by as much as 19 points following a 14-0 third-quarter run, but Minnesota narrowed the gap to two points in the final seconds with Julius Randle's driving layup. However, they couldn't capitalize as Naz Reid failed to attempt a game-winning 3-pointer before time expired. Boston's improved home performance saw them assisting on 25 of their 37 field goals, as they prepared to host the Los Angeles Clippers next, while Minnesota aimed to bounce back against Houston at home.
