**New York Knicks 109 - 114 Indiana Pacers**  
In an intense Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals, the Indiana Pacers edged out the New York Knicks 114-109, taking a commanding 2-0 lead in the series. Pascal Siakam shone with a playoff career-high 39 points, leading his team to victory and demonstrating his crucial role, as he was the only Pacer to make more than five baskets. Despite Jalen Brunson's 36 points and 11 assists for the Knicks, a crucial 13-4 run by the Pacers early in the fourth quarter, capped by Siakamâ€™s 3-pointer, proved decisive. The Knicks showed improvement after a heart-wrenching overtime loss in Game 1 but fell short, unable to recover from a sluggish start in the final quarter. This latest win marks the Pacers' sixth consecutive road victory since their Game 3 loss in the first round, while the Knicks face the daunting challenge of overcoming a 2-0 deficit, something no team has done in conference finals history after dropping the first two games at home.
