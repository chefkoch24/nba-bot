The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Dallas Mavericks 132-117, with Giannis Antetokounmpo nearly achieving a triple-double with 29 points, nine rebounds, and nine assists, alongside Damian Lillard's contribution of 28 points. Gary Trent Jr. also pitched in with 20 points, helping the Bucks secure their sixth victory in seven games and climb to fourth place in the Eastern Conference. Meanwhile, Kyrie Irving led the Mavericks with 31 points, hitting all his free throws despite struggling from the three-point line, reflecting Dallas's overall poor 28% accuracy from beyond the arc. The Mavericks, missing key players like Anthony Davis, relied on Moses Brown, who scored 18 points in his final game under a 10-day contract, as they grapple with salary cap constraints. The Bucks capitalized on Antetokounmpo and Lillard's strong performances to shift momentum before halftime, initiating the second half with a decisive run that solidified their lead. Milwaukee's high scoring translated to a notable 21-1 record when exceeding 120 points, while the Mavericks continued to battle injury challenges in the Western playoff race.
