**Los Angeles Rams 13 - 9 Arizona Cardinals**  
The Los Angeles Rams secured a 13-9 victory over the Arizona Cardinals, thanks to Ahkello Witherspoon's crucial end-zone interception in the final seconds. Kyler Murray threw for 321 yards but was intercepted twice late in the game, with Arizona struggling to capitalize on red-zone opportunities. Puka Nacua led the Rams with 129 receiving yards, and Kyren Williams scored the team's sole touchdown. Despite offensive difficulties, the Rams managed their fifth consecutive win, putting them on the edge of an NFC West title. The Rams can clinch the division if a combination of other teams secure outcomes in their favor over the next few days. Meanwhile, Michael Hoecht added to his season's achievements with a blocked extra-point attempt, marking his third blocked kick of the season. Looking ahead, the Rams will face Seattle next, while Arizona will conclude their season against the 49ers.

**New England Patriots 7 - 40 Los Angeles Chargers**  
The Los Angeles Chargers clinched a playoff berth with a commanding 40-7 victory over the New England Patriots, highlighted by Justin Herbert's three touchdown passes. This victory secured the Chargers' second postseason appearance in three years and marked coach Jim Harbaugh's fourth playoff entry in five NFL seasons. Herbert, who completed 26 of 38 passes for 281 yards, became only the third player in NFL history to surpass 3,000 passing yards and 20 touchdowns in each of his first five seasons, joining Peyton Manning and Russell Wilson. Chargers rookie receiver Ladd McConkey also stood out by surpassing 1,000 receiving yards for the season, becoming the third rookie in franchise history to achieve this milestone. The Patriots, struggling at 3-13 after six consecutive losses, saw quarterback Drake Maye continue his challenging rookie season, suffering an eighth straight game with a turnover. Despite Maye's touchdown pass streak, the Patriots' offense was limited, managing just 181 total yards against the Chargers' 428, further marred by injuries to key players.

**Cincinnati Bengals 30 - 24 Denver Broncos**  
In a gripping overtime clash that highlighted the Cincinnati Bengals' resilience, Joe Burrow connected with Tee Higgins for a decisive 3-yard touchdown pass, sealing a 30-24 victory against the Denver Broncos and keeping their playoff hopes alive. Burrow had a standout performance with 412 passing yards and three touchdowns, all to Higginsâ€”who amassed 131 receiving yards. Although Cade York missed a potential game-winning field goal, the Bengals capitalized on a subsequent Broncos punt to clinch their fourth straight victory. Burrow's ongoing record streak of eight games with at least 250 passing yards and three touchdowns further underscored his exceptional form. Meanwhile, Bo Nix and Marvin Mims Jr. formed a potent partnership for Denver, with Mims catching two crucial touchdowns. The game had significant playoff implications, as the Broncos missed the chance to secure an AFC wild card but will have another opportunity against the Kansas City Chiefs, while Cincinnati needs additional wins and outside help to make the postseason.
