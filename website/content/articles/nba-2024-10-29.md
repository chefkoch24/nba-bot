**Orlando Magic 119 - 115 Indiana Pacers**  
In a thrilling NBA matchup, Paolo Banchero delivered a career-best performance, scoring 50 points to lead the Orlando Magic to a 119-115 victory over the Indiana Pacers. Banchero's night was highlighted by his 13 rebounds and nine assists, and he remarkably tied a franchise record by scoring 37 points in the first half, a feat last achieved by Tracy McGrady in 2003. Jalen Suggs contributed 25 points and seven assists, while Mo Wagner added 14 points off the bench for Orlando. Despite the Pacers' spirited effort, led by Pascal Siakam's 26 points and Tyrese Haliburton's near triple-double, they faltered in the final minutes. A pivotal moment occurred when Banchero's backcourt steal and subsequent assist to Mo Wagner for a dunk narrowed the Pacers’ lead, reigniting Orlando's momentum. Notably, the Pacers, who attempted 30 free throws but converted only 20, did not shoot any free throws in the decisive fourth quarter. As each team looks towards their next games, the Magic aim to build on this victory as they start a five-game road trip against Chicago.

**New York Knicks 104 - 110 Cleveland Cavaliers**  
Darius Garland led the Cleveland Cavaliers to a 110-104 victory over the New York Knicks, scoring a season-high 34 points, including 15 in the decisive fourth quarter.

Donovan Mitchell, Evan Mobley, and Jarrett Allen also made significant contributions, with Allen securing a double-double of 15 points and 15 rebounds. Despite a strong performance from Jalen Brunson and support from Mikal Bridges and Josh Hart, the Knicks couldn't maintain their 13-point second-half lead, partly due to Brunson's ankle issue and inefficiency. The game featured an impressive, albeit non-counting, full-court shot by Mitchell post-buzzer. Garland's critical fourth-quarter threes erased the Knicks' last lead and secured the Cavaliers' win, setting the stage for their upcoming match against LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers.
