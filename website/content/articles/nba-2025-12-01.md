**Cleveland Cavaliers 115 - 117 Boston Celtics**  
In a thrilling matchup, Payton Pritchard led the Boston Celtics to a narrow 117-115 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers, scoring a season-high 42 points. Jaylen Brown achieved his fourth career triple-double with 19 points, 12 rebounds, and 11 assists, further cementing his recent performance streak after scoring 41 points in a loss against Minnesota. Despite Boston's dominant third-quarter 21-point lead, the Cavaliers, with Evan Mobley's 27 points and 14 rebounds, staged a fierce comeback. Donovan Mitchell, who had been relatively quiet until the game's closing moments, sparked hope with crucial late-game 3-pointers, finishing with 18 points. However, Pritchard's critical free throws in the final seconds solidified the win for the Celtics. Both teams were battling injuries, with Boston missing star Jayson Tatum all season and resting key players Derrick White and Neemias Queta, while Cleveland played without Jarrett Allen and Lonzo Ball, among others. The Celtics will face the Knicks next, while the Cavaliers are set to play the Pacers.
