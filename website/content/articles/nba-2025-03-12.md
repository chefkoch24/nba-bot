**Cleveland Cavaliers 109 - 104 Brooklyn Nets**  
The Cleveland Cavaliers extended their winning streak to 15 games, tying the longest streak in franchise history, with a comeback victory against the Brooklyn Nets, winning 109-104. All-Star Darius Garland led the charge, scoring 18 of his 30 points in the fourth quarter, while teammates Jarrett Allen and Evan Mobley contributed 23 and 21 points, respectively. Despite trailing by 18 points in the third quarter, the Cavaliers rallied for the win, improving their season record to 55-10, which ties for the fifth-best start in NBA history, and maintaining the best home record in the league at 30-4. The game was significant as Cleveland secured the Central Division title for the eighth time, with previous titles mainly achieved during LeBron Jamesâ€™ tenures. The Nets' Cam Thomas led his team with 27 points, but Brooklyn fell further out of playoff contention, now five games behind Chicago for the final play-in spot. The Cavaliers, who haven't lost since a game against Boston in early February, continue to demonstrate their strength as they aim to surpass this streak in upcoming games.

**Indiana Pacers 115 - 114 Milwaukee Bucks**  
In a thrilling finish, Tyrese Haliburton led the Indiana Pacers to a remarkable 115-114 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks with a sensational four-point play. Haliburton, who returned after missing three games due to a hip injury, sank a fadeaway 3-pointer while being fouled by Giannis Antetokounmpo, and then completed the free throw with just 3.4 seconds remaining. This stunning play allowed the Pacers to tie with the Bucks in the Eastern Conference standings. Giannis had a chance to win it for Milwaukee but missed a 3-point attempt at the buzzer. Haliburton contributed 14 points and 10 assists, while Pascal Siakam led Indiana with 25 points and 12 rebounds. For Milwaukee, Brook Lopez scored 23 points, and Antetokounmpo added 19 points and 17 rebounds. The Pacers had previously lost three games without Haliburton, and his return was pivotal in snapping that streak. Despite a late charge by Milwaukee, which included a 10-0 run to erase a 10-point deficit, the Bucks fell just short. The game was marked by its intensity and narrow margins, with neither team leading by more than five points in the closing minutes. The Bucks will next face the Los Angeles Lakers, while the Pacers are set to play against Philadelphia.
