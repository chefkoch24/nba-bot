**New York Islanders 2 - 5 Minnesota Wild**  
In a thrilling match at UBS Arena, the Minnesota Wild overcame the New York Islanders 4-2, thanks to quick third-period goals from Kirill Kaprizov and Joel Eriksson Ek, just 42 seconds apart. Kaprizov's power-play effort and Eriksson Ek's follow-up secured the win after Pat Maroon's early goal and an assist, building a formidable start. The victory marked Minnesota's second consecutive win after a four-game slump, with Marc-Andre Fleury contributing 27 saves and nearing a significant career milestone. Despite strong first and second periods, the Islanders struggled in the final section, resulting in their third loss in four games, as remarked by coach Lane Lambert who cited inconsistencies. Notably, Matt Boldy tallied another assist in his return from injury, marking his fourth contribution in three games.
