**Buffalo Bills 24 - 21 New England Patriots**  
The Buffalo Bills secured a hard-fought 24-21 victory over the New England Patriots, bolstered by James Cook's two touchdowns and three crucial turnovers forced by the Bills' defense. Notably, Taron Johnson's fumble recovery for a touchdown following a botched Patriots play was a game-changer, especially as quarterback Josh Allen was briefly sidelined with a hand injury he later described as hitting his "funny bone." Despite trailing 14-0, the Bills rallied, with Cook scoring on a 46-yard rush and a 4-yard reception. Allen returned to the field, easing concerns, and helped the Bills extend their home winning streak to ten games, even as their streak of scoring 30 or more points per game came to an end. Meanwhile, the Patriots, under their first-year head coach Jerod Mayo, suffered their fifth consecutive loss and continued to struggle with red-zone efficiency, including a crucial interception by Cam Lewis. The win allowed the Bills to maintain their slim chance at the AFC's top playoff seed, highlighting their resilience despite a sluggish start and significant absences on defense.

**New York Jets 9 - 19 Los Angeles Rams**  
In a thrilling game at East Rutherford, the Los Angeles Rams defeated the New York Jets 19-9, with a decisive moment coming when Rams tight end Tyler Higbee caught an 11-yard touchdown pass from Matthew Stafford early in the fourth quarter. Higbee's first game since major knee surgery saw him make an impressive dive into the end zone, securing the Rams' fourth consecutive victory and strengthening their lead in the NFC West. Amid freezing conditions, the Rams' defense turned the tide with Kam Curl's sack on Aaron Rodgers, leading to a crucial fumble recovery by Jared Verse. Rodgers, despite limping off temporarily, returned and connected with Davante Adams for his 499th regular-season touchdown, marking their 82nd scoring collaboration and placing them third in NFL history alongside Dan Marino and Mark Clayton. The Jets' early promise unraveled due to stalled drives and missed opportunities, including a missed 48-yard field goal attempt by Anders Carlson that could have kept them in contention late in the game. Injuries impacted both teams, with notable absences like Quinnen Williams and in-game setbacks for key players like Sauce Gardner. The Rams now prepare to host the Cardinals, while the Jets face the Bills.

**Las Vegas Raiders 19 - 14 Jacksonville Jaguars**  
The Las Vegas Raiders snapped a 10-game losing streak with a 19-14 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars, marking their first win since Sept. 29. Aidan O'Connell returned from injury to pass for 257 yards, while Brock Bowers caught 11 passes for 99 yards, just shy of breaking Mike Ditka’s record for rookie tight ends. The Jaguars, plagued by turnovers and penalties, lost two fumbles forced by Isaiah Pola-Mao, the first Raider since Charles Woodson to force multiple fumbles in a game. Despite the win moving the Raiders away from securing a top draft pick, the celebration among players and owner Mark Davis highlighted their relief and joy. The Jaguars, now on a poor run in close games, have moved to third in the draft order.

**Washington Commanders 36 - 33 Philadelphia Eagles**  
Jayden Daniels led the Washington Commanders to a thrilling 36-33 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles, ending the Eagles' 10-game winning streak. Despite trailing by 14 points early and a 13-point deficit entering the fourth quarter, Daniels threw five touchdown passes, including the game-winner to Jamison Crowder with six seconds remaining. This performance marked Daniels as the first Washington rookie quarterback to throw for five touchdowns and rush for over 65 yards in a game, showcasing his dual-threat capability. The comeback victory came despite several turnovers from Washington and Philadelphia losing Jalen Hurts to a concussion early in the game. Daniels' resilience against a strong Eagles defense, combined with overcoming multiple turnovers, was pivotal in preventing the Eagles from clinching the NFC East title. Notably, this game also saw Mark Rypien, the last Washington quarterback to achieve such a feat in 1991 and Super Bowl MVP, in attendance. As the Commanders enhance their playoff prospects, the Eagles face uncertainty with Hurts' status, aiming to rebound in their next matchup against Dallas.

**Atlanta Falcons 34 - 7 New York Giants**  
In his impressive NFL debut, Michael Penix Jr. led the Atlanta Falcons to a resounding 34-7 victory over the New York Giants, a win bolstered by a defense that returned two interceptions for touchdowns. Penix, the No. 8 overall draft pick, stepped in for the benched Kirk Cousins and completed 18 of 27 passes for 202 yards, despite some dropped passes. The Falcons' defense shone, with Jessie Bates and Matthew Judon each scoring pick-sixes, a rare feat for the franchise. This victory, Atlanta’s second straight win, pushed them to the top of the NFC South standings after Tampa Bay's loss to Dallas. Meanwhile, the Giants continued their spiral, taking a franchise-record tenth consecutive loss, with Drew Lock throwing multiple interceptions returned for scores and adding a lost fumble to his difficult day. The win keeps Atlanta's playoff hopes alive as they prepare for a crucial matchup against Washington.

**Seattle Seahawks 24 - 27 Minnesota Vikings**  
The Minnesota Vikings triumphed over the Seattle Seahawks with a tight 27-24 victory, thanks to Sam Darnold's impressive performance, which included executing a critical late-game touchdown pass to Justin Jefferson. Darnold, who went 22 of 35 for 246 yards and three touchdowns, displayed commendable improvisation, especially after a technical glitch in communications with head coach Kevin O'Connell during the final drive. Justin Jefferson was instrumental with 10 catches for 148 yards and two touchdowns, highlighting the strong synergy between him and Darnold. Despite Seattle's Geno Smith throwing for 314 yards and three touchdowns, including a late 4-yard pass to AJ Barner, the Vikings maintained their composure to secure the win, aided by Theo Jackson's interception in the final minute. This victory kept the Vikings on par with Detroit in the NFC standings, enhancing their chances of securing the top seed. The game also witnessed notable milestones, with DK Metcalf surpassing Steve Largent for sixth in the Seahawks' career touchdowns list, and Jaxon Smith-Njigba achieving his first 1,000-yard receiving season.

**Dallas Cowboys 26 - 24 Tampa Bay Buccaneers**  
The Dallas Cowboys secured a 26-24 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, with Cooper Rush throwing a touchdown and Brandon Aubrey contributing four field goals, including two from 58 yards. This defeat jeopardized Tampa Bay's playoff hopes, leaving them tied with Atlanta, who hold the tiebreaker.

CeeDee Lamb had an impressive performance, finishing with 105 receiving yards despite a shoulder issue. Baker Mayfield threw for 303 yards and two touchdowns but couldn't avoid the critical turnover.

**Cincinnati Bengals 24 - 6 Cleveland Browns**  
In a crucial game for their playoff aspirations, the Cincinnati Bengals defeated the Cleveland Browns 24-6, driven by Joe Burrow's three touchdown passes, including an impressive acrobatic throw to Tee Higgins while falling. Burrow's performance marked his seventh consecutive game with at least 250 passing yards and three touchdowns, breaking a record previously held by Tom Brady. Ja'Marr Chase also set a franchise record for receiving yards in a season with 1,510, outshining his previous 2021 record. Cleveland's struggles in the red zone, highlighted by fumbles and turnovers, contributed to their defeat, despite a notable 66-yard run by Jerome Ford. Myles Garrett reached a personal milestone with his 100th career sack, joining Lawrence Taylor in an elite group. Meanwhile, Cincinnati's Cade York tied a franchise record with a 59-yard field goal. The Bengals’ defense, after a generally tough season, shone by forcing nine turnovers over the past two games. The Browns will next host Miami, while the Bengals take on Denver.

This victory solidifies their position at the top of the NFC while also setting a new single-season scoring record with 493 points.

**Miami Dolphins 29 - 17 San Francisco 49ers**  
The Miami Dolphins kept their playoff hopes alive with a 29-17 victory over the San Francisco 49ers, who were eliminated from postseason contention before the game. Despite a disappointing loss the previous week, Miami relied on key performances to stay in the playoff race, including Kade Kohou's crucial interception of Brock Purdy and a sealing 50-yard touchdown run by De'Von Achane. Tua Tagovailoa contributed with 215 passing yards and a touchdown, and Jason Sanders was flawless with five field goals. Meanwhile, the 49ers struggled with penalties, being flagged 11 times for 90 yards, and ensured a losing season for the first time since 2020. Notably, Jonnu Smith set the Dolphins' single-season franchise records for receptions and receiving yards by a tight end, while Tyreek Hill's inconsistent performance saw him accountable for key drops. San Francisco's Deebo Samuel scored his first touchdown since Week 6, but it wasn't enough to counter Miami's balanced offensive and defensive efforts. With a record of 7-8, the Dolphins must win their remaining games and hope for losses from the Broncos and Chargers to reach the playoffs.
