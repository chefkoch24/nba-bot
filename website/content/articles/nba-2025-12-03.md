**Golden State Warriors 90 - 92 Oklahoma City Thunder**  
The Oklahoma City Thunder, boasting a 20-1 record, are off to the second-best start in NBA history and are set to face the Golden State Warriors, who opened the 2015-16 season with 24 consecutive wins. The Thunder are on a 12-game winning streak, defeating teams by an impressive average of 15.5 points per game, and are known for maintaining an aggressive, "hunter" mentality. As they face the Warriors in San Francisco, Oklahoma City is noted for its internal competition to keep players engaged, with Jalen Williams and Cason Wallace competing for most steals. Meanwhile, the Warriors will be without star Stephen Curry due to a right quadriceps contusion, but Seth Curry is expected to make his debut for the team. Both teams are dealing with injuries that could affect their performance, with key players like Al Horford and Trayce Jackson-Davis also missing games for the Warriors, and Isaiah Hartenstein and Alex Caruso recently sidelined for the Thunder. This matchup between Oklahoma City's dominant start and a slightly revamped Warriors roster is anticipated to be a compelling contest.
