**Detroit Pistons 114 - 103 Utah Jazz**  
The Detroit Pistons secured their fourth consecutive win by defeating the Utah Jazz 114-103, largely thanks to Cade Cunningham's remarkable 19-point effort in the fourth quarter, bringing his total to 31 points for the game.

In an intense matchup characterized by 12 lead changes and 10 ties, the Brooklyn Nets secured their first win of the season with a 112-103 victory over the Indiana Pacers. Michael Porter Jr. led the charge with 32 points, including four three-pointers, and 11 rebounds, crucially stepping up after the Nets' leading scorer, Cam Thomas, exited early due to hamstring tightness, echoing an injury that limited his previous season. The Nets, who had dropped their first seven games, also saw strong performances from Nic Claxton, Noah Clowney, Tyrese Martin, and Terance Mann, all contributing double-digit scoring. Despite a solid effort from the Pacers' Pascal Siakam, who scored 23 points and provided nine assists, along with support from Ben Sheppard and Jay Huff, Indiana stumbled to a 1-7 record.

**Dallas Mavericks 99 - 101 New Orleans Pelicans**  
The New Orleans Pelicans edged out the Dallas Mavericks 101-99, thanks to Saddiq Bey's standout performance with season highs of 22 points and nine rebounds. A crucial moment came when Dallas rookie Cooper Flagg missed a potential game-winning shot with two seconds left, allowing New Orleans' Trey Murphy III to secure the rebound. Despite the Mavericks introducing a new lineup, with Flagg moving to small forward and D'Angelo Russell starting as point guard, they fell short and have now lost three straight games. Flagg became Dallas' leading scorer for the first time, posting 20 points and nine rebounds. Klay Thompson came off the bench for the first time since March 2024, adding 11 points for the Mavericks. The Pelicans, playing without Zion Williamson and Jordan Poole, utilized their seventh different starting lineup in eight games.

**Denver Nuggets 122 - 112 Miami Heat**  
Nikola Jokic delivered an impressive performance with 33 points, 16 assists, and 15 rebounds, achieving his fifth triple-double of the season, as the Denver Nuggets defeated the Miami Heat 122-112. This victory marked Denver's 11th consecutive regular-season win over Miami and maintained their perfect 4-0 home record this season. Jokic secured his triple-double by grabbing an offensive rebound with over six minutes left in the third quarter. Aaron Gordon added 24 points for the Nuggets, while Jamal Murray closed the game with key free throws. Despite Miami's late push to narrow the gap, the Heat haven't won a regular-season game in Denver since 2016, though they did beat the Nuggets during Game 2 of the 2023 NBA Finals. Miami, missing Bam Adebayo after the first quarter due to a foot injury, was significantly outrebounded, and Norman Powell led them with 23 points. Additionally, the game held personal significance for Heat coach Erik Spoelstra, who described facing Nuggets coach David Adelman as "surreal" due to his close ties with the Adelman family.

**Portland Trail Blazers 121 - 119 Oklahoma City Thunder**  
The Portland Trail Blazers handed the Oklahoma City Thunder their first loss of the season, ending a strong start for the Thunder who were aiming for their 17th consecutive victory against the Blazers. Previously, the Thunder had dominated the series, including landmark victories with significant winning margins in past seasons. Despite having secured their eighth straight win earlier against the Los Angeles Clippers, thanks to a strong performance by reigning MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander with 30 points and 12 assists, the team's undefeated run came to a halt in Portland. Gilgeous-Alexander has been impressive, scoring 30 or more points in seven out of eight games and registering his 80th consecutive game scoring 20 or more points, tying with Oscar Robertson for the third-best streak in NBA history. The Thunder are 4-0 on the road, and Isaiah Joe contributed significantly with a season-high 22 points. Meanwhile, the Blazers were recovering from a loss to the Los Angeles Lakers, during which Deni Avdija and Shaedon Sharpe had notable performances, with Avdija achieving a season-best of 33 points. Interim coach Tiago Splitter emphasized the need for his team not to underestimate opponents, as was the case against the short-handed Lakers.

**Sacramento Kings 121 - 116 Golden State Warriors**  
In a game marked by the absence of some of the Golden State Warriors' key players, the Sacramento Kings are set to face a youthful Warriors lineup in Sacramento. Stephen Curry is sidelined with illness, Draymond Green will likely rest, and Jimmy Butler III remains questionable due to back soreness following their recent victory over the Phoenix Suns. Despite playing through a cold, Curry delivered an impressive 28 points in that game, but prioritizing his health, he has been ruled out for the match against the Kings. Warriors coach Steve Kerr emphasized the importance of rest for Curry amid a taxing schedule, while Butler's status hangs in the balance after leaving Tuesday's game early. Meanwhile, the Kings are keen to avoid a repeat of their sluggish start against the Denver Nuggets and look to maintain defensive intensity from the outset. On a brighter note for Sacramento, Russell Westbrook delivered a standout performance with 26 points, 12 rebounds, and 6 assists, earning praise from coach Doug Christie for his high-energy play and competitiveness.
