"Some of the plays like J.J. \[Moser\] did in the third period, the great backcheck on \[<forge-entity title="Alex Ovechkin" slug="alex-ovechkin-8471214" code="player">Alex Ovechkin</forge-entity>\]. I don’t want to see that in the third ... ‘Ovi’ all alone in front. Great job by everyone." 
<forge-entity title="Charlie Lindgren" slug="charlie-lindgren-8479292" code="player">Charlie Lindgren</forge-entity> made 18 saves for the Capitals (5-2-0), who had their five-game winning streak end.

"I thought we played a good game,” Washington coach Spencer Carbery said. “Territorial we were OK. … They've got a good team and they've got a top six that's as good as anybody in the NHL, so they are going to get you on your heels for a couple of sequences. But overall we created a ton of good looks. Just didn't make that play that we needed to make, couldn't make that last play."

"In the second period tonight I thought we bent a bit but we didn't break," Tampa Bay coach Jon Cooper said. "So, now we get to go in 1-0, we don't give up the lead, then come out and score those two quick ones early (in the third period) and kind of popped their balloon." 
<forge-entity title="Brayden Point" slug="brayden-point-8478010" code="player">Brayden Point</forge-entity> extended the lead to 2-0 at 2:26 of the third when he scored from the edge of the crease to finish a give-and-go with Kucherov.

"But that's hockey sometimes. We've got to find a way to kind of crack it open in those games when there's not much of anything going on."

Geekie made it 3-0 at 3:10 with a one-timer from the left face-off circle off a pass by <forge-entity title="Anthony Cirelli" slug="anthony-cirelli-8478519" code="player">Anthony Cirelli</forge-entity>.
