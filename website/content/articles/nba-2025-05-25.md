**Minnesota Timberwolves 143 - 101 Oklahoma City Thunder**  
In a crucial Game 3 of the Western Conference finals, the Minnesota Timberwolves rebounded from two tough losses with a dominant 143-101 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder, cutting the series deficit to 2-1. Anthony Edwards led the way for Minnesota, scoring 30 points, grabbing nine rebounds, and dishing out six assists in just three quarters. His aggressive play and improved three-point shooting, alongside strong bench contributions from Julius Randle (24 points) and rookie Terrence Shannon Jr. (15 points in 13 minutes), overwhelmed the Thunder's usually stout defense. The Timberwolves capitalized on a disappointing night for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the newly named NBA MVP, who struggled with just 14 points and four turnovers. The Thunder never recovered after being blitzed early, unable to rally as their shooting plummeted at the Target Center. Edwards' dynamic play, especially a baseline spin and reverse layup, highlighted the teamâ€™s renewed intensity, setting up Game 4 to be held in Minneapolis with newfound momentum.
