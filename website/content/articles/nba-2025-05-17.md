**New York Knicks 119 - 81 Boston Celtics**  
The New York Knicks advanced to the Eastern Conference finals for the first time in 25 years with a commanding 119-81 victory over the Boston Celtics, ending the Celtics' title reign. Jalen Brunson and OG Anunoby each scored 23 points, while the Knicks' 38-point margin marked their largest postseason victory. Despite losing star Jayson Tatum to injury earlier in the series, Boston struggled to compete, with coach Joe Mazzulla pulling starters in the third quarter as the deficit grew. New York's defense shone, highlighted by Deuce McBrideâ€™s impressive block leading to a pivotal basket. Fans celebrated both inside and outside Madison Square Garden, where celebrities like Ben Stiller and Lenny Kravitz joined in the festivities. The Knicks will next face the Indiana Pacers in a rematch of their 2000 conference finals meeting.
