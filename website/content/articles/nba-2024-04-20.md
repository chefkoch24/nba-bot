Zion Williamson will be out for the crucial play-in game between the New Orleans Pelicans and the Sacramento Kings as he recovers from a left hamstring injury, despite putting up impressive numbers in their last game. The Kings have lost all five regular-season matchups against the Pelicans, with sharpshooter Keegan Murray stepping up in their recent win over the Golden State Warriors. Sacramento will need to find a way to finally defeat New Orleans to secure a spot in the playoffs, while dealing with injuries to Kevin Huerter and Malik Monk.
