**New York Knicks 123 - 124 Chicago Bulls**  
The Chicago Bulls narrowly defeated the New York Knicks 124-123 in a thrilling encounter at Madison Square Garden. Zach LaVine led the Bulls with 31 points, while Colby White contributed 22, including the decisive free throws with just three seconds left in the game.

However, White was fouled on a 3-point attempt by Josh Hart on the next play and secured the victory by making all three free throws. Despite Karl-Anthony Towns scoring a season-high 46 points and grabbing 10 rebounds, and Brunson adding 24 points, the Knicks couldn't steal the win as Brunson's final shot rimmed out at the buzzer. The game highlighted strong performances and dramatic shifts in momentum, especially with the Knicks' impressive 17-0 run to close the third quarter. Meanwhile, Lonzo Ball continued to be sidelined for the Bulls with lingering injuries, and the Knicks showcased consistency by sticking with the same starting lineup in every game so far this season.

**Philadelphia 76ers 106 - 114 Cleveland Cavaliers**  
The Cleveland Cavaliers continued their scorching start to the NBA season by becoming the sixth team in NBA history to begin with a 13-0 record, defeating the Philadelphia 76ers 114-106.

**Oklahoma City Thunder 106 - 88 New Orleans Pelicans**  
In an impressive display, Jalen Williams scored 31 points, and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander added 29 as the Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the undermanned New Orleans Pelicans 106-88. This victory marked the Thunder's second consecutive win without Chet Holmgren, who is sidelined with a pelvic fracture.

Despite being outrebounded 58-31, the Thunder committed only seven turnovers, while New Orleans struggled with 24 turnovers. The Pelicans, playing without key injured players like Zion Williamson and CJ McCollum, couldnâ€™t overcome Oklahoma City's strong guard-heavy lineup.

In a thrilling contest, Giannis Antetokounmpo powered the Milwaukee Bucks to a 127-120 overtime win against the Detroit Pistons, scoring 59 points, the highest in the league this season.

Detroit, missing key starters Jaden Ivey and Tim Hardaway Jr., was led by Cade Cunningham's 35 points. In a dramatic climax, Ron Holland II failed to capitalize on two free throws with one second left in regulation, leaving the score tied.

**San Antonio Spurs 139 - 130 Washington Wizards**  
Victor Wembanyama exploded for a career-high 50 points, leading the San Antonio Spurs to a 139-130 triumph over the Washington Wizards. The 20-year-old standout also hit a personal best of eight 3-pointers, marking his third consecutive game with at least six successful long-range shots. This performance makes Wembanyama the fourth-youngest NBA player to score 50 points in a game, placing him among elite company alongside Brandon Jennings, LeBron James, and Devin Booker. Despite the loss, Jordan Poole shone for the Wizards with a notable 42-point effort, as his team suffered its sixth consecutive defeat. Alexandre Sarr provided some excitement for Washington with a block and dunk against his French compatriot Wembanyama. The Spurs have further cause for optimism with Devin Vassell scoring 17 points in his return from surgery, and Wembanyama becoming the first player in NBA history to achieve 20 3-pointers and 25 blocks over six games.

**Portland Trail Blazers 106 - 98 Minnesota Timberwolves**  
In a notable 122-108 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves, the Portland Trail Blazers showcased their talents with Robert Williams III returning from a year-long knee injury to deliver an impressive performance. Williams contributed 19 points, nine rebounds, and a remarkable defensive effort including three blocks and steals in just his third appearance this season, underscoring his value to the team. Portland had seven players scoring in double digits, including Jerami Grant with a team-high 21 points and Shaedon Sharpe and Deni Avdija with 17 each. The game also marked a difference in Minnesota's performance compared to their previous dominant win over Portland, as they struggled with a season-worst 23 turnovers. Despite strong efforts from Naz Reid and Anthony Edwards, who scored 28 and 26 points respectively, the Timberwolves could not overcome their ball-handling issues. Portland's triumph broke Minnesota's five-game winning streak against them, illustrating both the impact of Williams' return and the Blazers' improved execution.

**Sacramento Kings 127 - 104 Phoenix Suns**  
In a rematch filled with notable absences due to injuries, the Sacramento Kings and Phoenix Suns are set to face off again after the Kings secured a 127-118 overtime victory in their last encounter. DeMar DeRozan played a critical role in the Kings' triumph, outscoring the Suns 8-7 by himself during overtime, while De'Aaron Fox added another eight points, leading Sacramento to victory. The Suns, playing without Kevin Durant due to a strained calf, and potentially without Bradley Beal, who also suffered a calf strain, had Devin Booker to thank for his 31-point effort and Beal for his 24 points in their recent win against the Utah Jazz. Meanwhile, Sacramento's key player Malik Monk is sidelined with a sprained ankle, contributing to their earlier loss against San Antonio. Monk, averaging 12.6 points per game off the bench this season, is hopeful to return by the end of the month. The anticipated rematch is further heightened by these teams' need to adapt to missing personnel as the NBA Cup continues.
