**Washington Capitals 3 - 2 Nashville Predators**  
In a thrilling matchup at Capital One Arena, Alex Ovechkin extended his goal streak to five games by scoring the game-winning goal to lead the Washington Capitals to a 3-2 victory over the Nashville Predators. Ovechkin, who also recorded an assist, now has six goals during this streak and 861 career NHL goals, just 34 shy of Wayne Gretzky's record. Connor McMichael and Aliaksei Protas also scored for the Capitals, who have won seven straight home games, while Dylan Strome added two assists. Logan Thompson, undefeated since joining the Capitals, made 33 crucial saves. Despite Juuso Parssinen and Steven Stamkos scoring for the Predators, a potential game-tying goal by Marc Del Gaizo was overturned due to goaltender interference. Washington owner Ted Leonsis celebrated his 1,000th win as the team's owner, while Nashville's efforts were marred by penalties and a key injury scratch in Tommy Novak.

**Chicago Blackhawks 1 - 4 Detroit Red Wings**  
In a commanding 4-1 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks, Dylan Larkin and Alex DeBrincat led the Detroit Red Wings at United Center. Both players contributed a goal and an assist, with DeBrincat securing an early lead and Larkin continuing his scoring streak. Andrew Copp and Joe Veleno, who scored his first goal of the season, also contributed to the win. Detroit's goalie, Cam Talbot, made 28 saves, extending his point streak to four games, making him the oldest Red Wings goaltender to achieve such a streak since Chris Osgood. Despite feeling dominant recently, the Blackhawks struggled with energy and decision-making, as noted by Chicagoâ€™s coach Luke Richardson. Notably, Patrick Kane played his second game against his former team, contributing two shots on goal and continuing to climb the Blackhawks' franchise history rankings in points, assists, and goals.

**Edmonton Oilers 2 - 4 Vegas Golden Knights**  
Noah Hanifin's two third-period goals propelled the Vegas Golden Knights to a 4-2 victory over the Edmonton Oilers at Rogers Place, marking their first road win of the season. Jack Eichel contributed significantly with a goal and two assists, while Ivan Barbashev added three assists for the surging Golden Knights, who have won six of their last seven games. The Oilers' Brett Kulak and Zach Hyman scored, but Connor McDavid was held scoreless in his return from an ankle injury. Despite a tightly contested game, Hanifin's late-game heroics secured the win, with his second goal coming just 49 seconds before the final whistle. Mark Stone sealed the victory with an empty-netter, and an injury to Oilers defenseman Troy Stecher added to Edmonton's struggles.
