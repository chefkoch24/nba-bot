**New York Knicks 140 - 106 Milwaukee Bucks**  
Jalen Brunson scored an impressive 44 points in leading the New York Knicks to a commanding 140-106 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks, despite briefly leaving the game due to an apparent injury. Brunson's explosive performance included 23 points in the first quarter alone, and he became the third Knick to achieve 40 points in a game for the 17th time, tying Carmelo Anthony on the franchise list. Karl-Anthony Towns contributed with 30 points and 18 rebounds, helping the Knicks overcome a recent slump by shooting 58% from the field. The Knicks amassed 75 points by halftime, marking the most the Bucks have conceded in a half this season. Giannis Antetokounmpo's 24 points and 13 rebounds, along with Damian Lillard's 22 points, were not enough to prevent the end of Milwaukee's three-game winning streak. The Bucks also endured their largest point tally allowed this season and faced two blowout losses in New York.

The win marked Denver's 12th victory in their last 17 games and their first time being eight games over .500 this season with a 23-15 record.

DeMar DeRozan, who was warmly received on his return to Chicago, scored 21 points, facing his former team for the first time since the off-season trade.

**Boston Celtics 120 - 119 New Orleans Pelicans**  
The Boston Celtics narrowly defeated the New Orleans Pelicans 120-119, with Jayson Tatum leading the charge with 38 points and 11 rebounds, while Kristaps Porzingis contributed 19 points and 11 boards. Despite Zion Williamson's return from a one-game suspension and his contribution of 16 points and seven rebounds, the Pelicans couldn't clinch the win. The game was marked by Boston's shooting struggles, including their 13-for-44 performance from long distance. New Orleans capitalized on Boston's early 3-point woes, leading by 11 in the first quarter. In a nail-biting finish, Derrick White's failed inbound attempt gave the Pelicans a chance to steal the game, but C.J. McCollum's potentially game-winning layup was off target. The Celtics improved to 7-6 over the last 13 games, while injuries have limited Williamson's participation in just eight of New Orleans' first 40 games.

**Utah Jazz 112 - 111 Brooklyn Nets**  
The Utah Jazz secured a thrilling 112-111 overtime victory against the Brooklyn Nets, highlighted by Isaiah Collier's decisive layup with just two seconds remaining. Collier, achieving a career-high of 23 points along with seven rebounds and assists, was instrumental in breaking the Jazz's three-game losing streak, with support from Collin Sexton's 21 points.

Despite Tosan Evbuomwan's effort to keep Brooklyn competitive with 22 points, along with significant contributions from Ziaire Williams, Ben Simmons, and Nic Claxton, the Nets succumbed to their fifth consecutive defeat. Key missed shots and free throws impeded Brooklyn's chances, while Utah's 39% efficiency from beyond the arc, including 17 3-pointers, proved decisive. Both teams were shorthanded, missing players due to injuries, but managed to stage a dramatic contest with Utah ultimately prevailing at home.
