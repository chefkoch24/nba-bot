**Detroit Pistons 119 - 125 Milwaukee Bucks**  
The Milwaukee Bucks secured the No. 5 seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs with a 125-119 victory over the Detroit Pistons, highlighted by Giannis Antetokounmpo's impressive 32-point, 15-assist, and 11-rebound performance.

Meanwhile, the Pistons made a remarkable turnaround by adding 30 wins to their previous season's low, earning their first playoff berth since 2019 as the sixth seed. Cade Cunningham showcased his talent with 36 points for Detroit, who will go up against the third-seeded New York Knicks.

**Indiana Pacers 115 - 129 Orlando Magic**  
In a game of benched starters, the Orlando Magic cruised past the Indiana Pacers 129-115, powered by Trevelin Queen's career-high 25 points and Anthony Black's impressive 21-point, six-rebound, and seven-assist performance. The Magic secured their fifth consecutive win after already clinching a spot in the play-in tournament. Notably, Orlando's explosive 17-4 run early in the second quarter, followed by a 14-0 surge, broke the game open as they shot a season-best 57.6% from the field. Indiana, having rested all its starters, saw their six-game winning streak end, locking them into the No. 4 seed for a playoff rematch against the Milwaukee Bucks. Despite an off-kilter night for the Pacers, Bennedict Mathurin's 20 points and eight rebounds stood out as Indiana struggled to find rhythm offensively under Coach Rick Carlisle's atypical rotations. Both teams witnessed eight players scoring in double figures, but it was Orlando who executed a perfect plan, emphasizing the impact of their bench players in the win.

**Boston Celtics 130 - 94 Charlotte Hornets**  
The Boston Celtics secured their 60th win of the season by defeating the Charlotte Hornets 130-94, with Payton Pritchard and Sam Hauser leading the charge with 22 and 20 points respectively. Derrick White added 19 points, while Jayson Tatum and Al Horford contributed significantly in rebounds and assists, emphasizing Boston's depth despite resting starters in the final quarter. Jaylen Brown's absence due to a sore knee could impact the Celtics' playoff aspirations, as he missed the game threshold for postseason awards. Meanwhile, the Hornets, enduring a challenging season, were led by Seth Curry's 17 points, which may make him the NBA's 3-point percentage leader. Notably, Tatum completed a four-point play in the third quarter, helping Boston extend a slim halftime lead. The Celtics, who recently set the league record for three-pointers in a season, have achieved 60 wins for the 15th time in franchise history and are aiming to defend their championship title.

**New York Knicks 102 - 108 Cleveland Cavaliers**  
The Cleveland Cavaliers completed a season sweep over the New York Knicks with a thrilling 108-102 victory, despite missing All-Star Donovan Mitchell and key reserves. Darius Garland led the charge with 13 of his 26 points coming in the decisive fourth quarter, overturning a 23-point deficit. This game solidified the Knicks' struggles against top Eastern Conference teams, as they finished 0-8 against the Cavaliers and the Boston Celtics, who also swept them. Jalen Brunson's 27 points weren't enough for a Knicks team that rested key player Karl-Anthony Towns but otherwise had their regular lineup. The Knicks secured the No. 3 seed, unable to surpass the Indiana Pacers after their loss to Orlando, while the Cavaliers are riding high with a strong finish at Madison Square Garden, holding a 16-4 record in their last 20 regular season games there. The Cavaliers are preparing for a playoff run as Mitchell is expected to return, while the Knicks are set to face Detroit in the playoffs, acknowledging their challenges ahead.

Meanwhile, the Wizards, enduring an NBA-worst season, suffered another heavy loss, marking the eighth time they've been defeated by at least 30 points. Despite missing guard Josh Giddey due to a hand injury, the Bulls excelled from the free-throw line, making 20 of 22 attempts, and never looked back after taking the lead early in the second quarter.

**New Orleans Pelicans 104 - 153 Miami Heat**  
The Miami Heat delivered a dominating performance against the New Orleans Pelicans, winning 153-104, marking the Pelicans' most lopsided regular-season loss in their franchise history. Bam Adebayo led the Heat with 23 points and 12 rebounds in just 22 minutes, while Tyler Herro and Duncan Robinson added 22 and 21 points, respectively, with Herro's 3-pointer sparking a key 10-0 run.

Impressively, ten Miami players scored at least 10 points, tying an NBA record not achieved since 1994. The Pelicans, struggling with injuries, fielded only eight players, resulting in their sixth consecutive loss.

**Dallas Mavericks 124 - 102 Toronto Raptors**  
Anthony Davis delivered a stellar performance with 23 points, 13 rebounds, 10 assists, and a season-high seven blocks, achieving his fourth career triple-double as the Dallas Mavericks triumphed over the Toronto Raptors 124-102. This victory snapped a three-game losing streak for the Mavericks and secured their spot in the Western Conference play-in elimination game against Sacramento. Key contributions came from reserves Max Christie and Brandon Williams, both scoring 17 points, as Dallas decisively outscored Toronto 31-13 in the pivotal second quarter, highlighted by a 16-0 run. Despite notable efforts from Scottie Barnes and Ochai Agbaji, who matched a career high with six 3-pointers, the Raptors struggled with a depleted lineup and poor shooting. Dallas capitalized on Torontoâ€™s struggles, leading by as many as 38 points, and shooting 65% in the decisive quarter while the Raptors floundered at a mere 19.4%. Williams, having just signed a multi-year contract, rejoined the lineup and Dereck Lively II's alley-oop dunk from Davis helped cement the victory. The Mavericks will conclude the regular season against Memphis, while Toronto faces San Antonio next.

**Minnesota Timberwolves 117 - 91 Brooklyn Nets**  
Rudy Gobert powered the Minnesota Timberwolves to a decisive 117-91 victory over the Brooklyn Nets, tying his career high with 35 points and securing 11 rebounds. This win puts the Timberwolves closer to avoiding the play-in games by finishing in the top six of the Western Conference. Julius Randle contributed 21 points to the Timberwolves' effort, which was overshadowed by Anthony Edwards' struggles; he scored only nine points and incurred his 18th technical foul, guaranteeing him a suspension for the crucial next game. The Nets, who are poised to end the season with their worst record in eight years, fielded a rookie-laden lineup, with Keon Johnson leading their scoring at 20 points. Missing key players Nic Claxton and Ziaire Williams, Brooklyn couldn't contain Gobert in the paint, as he capitalized on the open space. The Timberwolves' strong performance puts them in a favorable position to clinch a better playoff seed, while Brooklyn aims to conclude their season positively against New York.

The Oklahoma City Thunder's reserves, led by Aaron Wiggins' 35 points and Isaiah Joe's 32 points with a career-high 10 three-pointers, powered their team to a dominant 145-111 win over the struggling Utah Jazz. Jaylin Williams contributed a triple-double with 15 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists, marking the Thunder's 31st road victory this season, second only to Boston.

After a brief 10-2 run narrowed the deficit to 48-44 in the second quarter, the Thunder's sharp perimeter shootingâ€”hitting 13 three-pointers for a 45% success rate in the first halfâ€”helped them secure a comfortable lead.

Despite recent struggles and being eliminated from playoff contention, the win provided Suns fans with a positive note in a season that began with optimism but faltered.

The season finale for both teams will see the Spurs hosting Toronto and the Suns visiting Sacramento.

**Portland Trail Blazers 86 - 103 Golden State Warriors**  
The Golden State Warriors are in playoff mode as they prepare for a crucial regular-season game against the Portland Trail Blazers. Despite a tough 114-111 loss to the San Antonio Spurs on a last-second 3-pointer by former Warrior Harrison Barnes, the Warriors remain in the hunt for a higher playoff seed.

Historically, Golden State has dominated Portland, having won their last eight meetings and 12 of the last 13. In contrast, the Trail Blazers, who are out of playoff contention, have struggled with injuries but have seen individual growth, such as Shaedon Sharpe's career-high 37 points in a recent game. Portland coach Chauncey Billups emphasized learning from the close losses and addressing issues such as turnovers and free-throw shooting. Despite their current record, it's been a season of growth for the young Blazers squad.

**Sacramento Kings 100 - 101 LA Clippers**  
The Los Angeles Clippers extended their winning streak to six games with a commanding 134-117 victory over the Houston Rockets, bolstered by Ivica Zubac's first career triple-double and Kawhi Leonard's impressive scoring run. This victory accentuates their late-season momentum, as the Clippers have won 13 of their last 15 games and are edging towards securing a top seed in the Western Conference playoffs. Despite missing Norman Powell, who is expected back soon, the Clippers continue their Northern California road trip against the Sacramento Kings. The Kings, on the other hand, saw their three-game winning streak end with a 124-116 loss to the Denver Nuggets, despite Zach LaVine's 27 points and a strong scoring performance by their backcourt. As they aim to solidify their position for the play-in tournament, Sacramento is buoyed by LaVine finding his rhythm following his mid-season trade. Both teams are striving to maintain momentum as the season concludes.
