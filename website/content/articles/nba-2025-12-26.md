**New York Knicks 126 - 124 Cleveland Cavaliers**  
In a thrilling Christmas Day matchup, the New York Knicks staged a remarkable comeback to defeat the Cleveland Cavaliers 126-124, after trailing by 17 points in the fourth quarter. Jalen Brunson led the Knicks with 34 points, including a crucial go-ahead 3-pointer with just over a minute remaining. Key contributions from reserves Jordan Clarkson, who scored 25 points, and Tyler Kolek, who added 16 points and nine assists, were pivotal in the Knicks’ victory. The energetic Mitchell Robinson secured 13 rebounds, sustaining vital possessions for New York down the stretch. Despite a strong start from the Cavaliers, who surged to an 18-3 lead with Donovan Mitchell's impressive play, and further extending their advantage in the third quarter, they were unable to hold on for the win. Mitchell ended the game with 34 points, while Darius Garland contributed 20 points and 10 assists. The loss prevented Cleveland from securing a third consecutive win, despite notable performances, including Evan Mobley’s return to the lineup.

**Oklahoma City Thunder 102 - 117 San Antonio Spurs**  
In a triumphant display, the San Antonio Spurs claimed their eighth consecutive victory by defeating the Oklahoma City Thunder 117-102, marking their third win over the defending NBA champions within two weeks. De'Aaron Fox led the Spurs with 29 points, while Victor Wembanyama contributed with 19 points and 11 rebounds, and Stephon Castle added 19 points and seven assists. San Antonio showcased efficiency by shooting 53.6% from the field and restricting Oklahoma City to 38.9% shooting. Despite Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's 22-point effort for the Thunder, his shooting struggled with just 7 of 19 from the field, extending his streak of scoring at least 20 points to 102 consecutive games. The Thunder, who started their season impressively at 24-1, have now suffered three defeats to the Spurs in their recent 2-4 run. The Spurs took control of the game by turning an early deficit into a 69-60 halftime lead, extending it to 95-79 by the end of the third quarter, and ultimately securing the victory. The Spurs (23-7) are set to host the Utah Jazz next, while the Thunder will face the Philadelphia 76ers.

**Golden State Warriors 126 - 116 Dallas Mavericks**  
The Golden State Warriors secured their third consecutive win by defeating the Dallas Mavericks 126-116 in a Christmas Day matchup in San Francisco. Stephen Curry led the Warriors with 23 points and hit a crucial 3-pointer late in the game, while Jimmy Butler added a near triple-double performance with 14 points, nine assists, and nine rebounds. Mavericks rookie sensation Cooper Flagg impressed with 27 points in his holiday debut. Klay Thompson made a notable return against his former team after missing a game due to knee soreness, receiving a warm reception when entering the game. Mavericks' Anthony Davis exited early with groin spasms, contributing minimally before his departure. Despite an initially slow start from beyond the arc, the Warriors gained momentum with Moses Moody and Al Horford, who returned from a seven-game absence and went perfect from the 3-point line. Draymond Green managed to contribute despite foul trouble, following a recent on-court disagreement with coach Steve Kerr. The Warriors continue their away fixtures against Toronto, while the Mavericks head to Sacramento.

**Los Angeles Lakers 96 - 119 Houston Rockets**  
In a dominant performance on Christmas Day, the Houston Rockets defeated the Los Angeles Lakers 117-96 in Los Angeles, marking the Lakers' third consecutive loss. Amen Thompson led the Rockets with 26 points, while Kevin Durant added 25 points and nine assists, helping end Houston's two-game losing streak. Despite Luka Doncic and LeBron James scoring 25 and 18 points respectively, their combined shooting from beyond the arc was lackluster at 4 of 11, and they contributed significantly to the Lakers' 16 turnovers. Doncic's return after a minor injury could not prevent the Lakers' struggle, particularly on the boards, as the Rockets, led by Alperen Sengun's 12 rebounds, dominated the glass 48-25. Houston controlled the game early, leading by 14 points in the first quarter and extending their advantage with an 18-5 run in the third quarter. The Lakers were further hindered by injuries, with Rui Hachimura scoring no points and Austin Reaves leaving the game due to a sore calf after contributing 12 points. The Lakers' longstanding Christmas game tradition saw them play for the 27th consecutive year, yet they failed to rally as the Rockets held firm to close the game.

**Denver Nuggets 111 - 107 Minnesota Timberwolves**  
In a tense matchup leading into Christmas, the Denver Nuggets' four-game road win streak was halted by a narrow 131-130 defeat to the Dallas Mavericks, but the loss cut deeper as forward Cameron Johnson suffered a knee injury. Fortunately, Johnson avoided structural damage, yet his bone bruise means he’ll be sidelined indefinitely, further thinning Denver’s lineup, already missing starters Aaron Gordon and Christian Braun due to injuries. As the Nuggets prepare to face the surging Minnesota Timberwolves, who have flourished recently with Anthony Edwards leading the charge, Denver will lean even more on their stars Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray to fill the void. Head coach David Adelman must navigate this challenge strategically, potentially elevating Spencer Jones to maintain the bench rotation. Despite losing both earlier season encounters with Denver, the Timberwolves have a strong track record in recent trips to Colorado and are brimming with confidence, particularly from Edwards, who aims to deliver a standout performance on a night watched by fans worldwide.
