**Utah Jazz 124 - 127 Philadelphia 76ers**  
Maxey, a first-time All-Star, scored a career-high 51 points to lead the Joel Embiid-less 76ers to a 127-124 victory over the Jazz. Embiid is out with an injured knee, but Maxey stepped up with an impressive performance, including hitting two crucial free throws in the final seconds. The win was much needed for the 76ers, who were on a four-game losing streak. Maxey finished the game with 17 of 27 shooting, 7 of 9 on 3-pointers, and 10 of 11 on free throws, becoming the first 76er to achieve such a feat. The Jazz, on the other hand, have now lost three in a row and will look to bounce back when they host Milwaukee next.

**New York Knicks 109 - 105 Indiana Pacers**  
Jalen Brunson scored 40 points, including the go-ahead basket, leading the New York Knicks to their ninth straight win with a 109-105 victory over the Indiana Pacers. This impressive performance came on the night Brunson earned his first All-Star nod and despite suffering an eye injury during the game. The Knicks, playing without key starters due to injuries, rallied from a 15-point deficit to secure the win, outrebounding the Pacers and dominating in second-chance points. Indiana's struggles on the boards proved to be the difference, as they failed to capitalize on their early lead. With this win, the Knicks continue their hot streak heading into their next matchup against the Los Angeles Lakers.
