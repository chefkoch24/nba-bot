The Detroit Pistons clinched a significant victory over the Eastern Conference-leading Cleveland Cavaliers, winning 133-122, marking their first winning season since 2016. Tim Hardaway Jr. shone with a season-high 32 points, while Detroit remained resilient despite missing Cade Cunningham due to a calf injury. Dennis Schroder, filling in for Cunningham, contributed 16 points and 10 assists, while Jalen Duren added 16 points and 13 rebounds. The victory ended a 12-game losing streak against Cleveland for the Pistons, who now aim for their first 45-win season since 2007-08. Although Donovan Mitchell's impressive 38-point performance, including 22 in the fourth quarter, brought the Cavaliers close, Detroit answered with a decisive 12-1 run to secure the win. The Cavaliers, on the cusp of their first 60-win season since 2009-10, will next face the LA Clippers, while the Pistons head to Minnesota for a three-game trip.

**Brooklyn Nets 100 - 132 LA Clippers**  
The Los Angeles Clippers thoroughly defeated the Brooklyn Nets 132-100, led by Kawhi Leonard's impressive 31-point performance, which included a stellar 5-of-6 from three-point range. Leonard's efficiency was highlighted by making all six of his free throws, collecting six rebounds, four steals, and two blocks in just 27 minutes of play. Ivica Zubac contributed significantly with 21 points on a perfect 9-for-9 shooting and 12 rebounds, climbing to sixth place on the Clippers' career rebounds list. The Clippers rallied from a first-quarter deficit, outscoring the Nets 79-42 in the second and third quarters combined. This victory marks the Clippers' 10th win in their last 12 games, helping them maintain their position in the Western Conference playoff race. On the other side, the Nets continue to struggle, recording their sixth consecutive loss and falling to a dismal 1-9 in their last 10 games. Notably, Drew Timme made a commendable NBA debut for the Nets with 11 points and 10 rebounds.

**Toronto Raptors 108 - 97 Charlotte Hornets**  
Jakob Poeltl led the Toronto Raptors to a 108-97 victory over the Charlotte Hornets, marking their third consecutive win. Poeltl contributed significantly with 24 points and 12 rebounds, while Immanuel Quickley added 19 points, including five 3-pointers, along with nine assists. The game saw Toronto use a 10-point run early in the first quarter to establish a lead, which they maintained despite Charlotte's efforts, primarily hindered by LaMelo Ball's absence due to a season-ending injury. Mark Williams stood out for the Hornets with 18 points and 12 rebounds, but it wasn't enough to prevent their fourth straight loss. Toronto's recent victories have come against lower-ranked Eastern Conference teams, and they hope to continue this momentum against the Philadelphia 76ers. The Raptors' success was emphasized by their effective 3-point shooting, outperforming the Hornets by 15 points from beyond the arc.

**Milwaukee Bucks 107 - 116 New York Knicks**  
In a commanding performance, the New York Knicks swept their season series with the Milwaukee Bucks by securing a 116-107 victory on Friday night, marking the Bucks' third consecutive loss. OG Anunoby delivered an outstanding fourth quarter, scoring 20 of his 31 points in that period, while Mikal Bridges contributed 26 points. Despite injuries in their backcourt, the Knicks received strong efforts from reserves Delon Wright, who had his first double-figure game of the season, and former Marquette star Tyler Kolek. Josh Hart also shone with 13 points, 14 rebounds, and eight assists. Milwaukee’s Giannis Antetokounmpo made a remarkable return with 30 points following a game missed due to a sprained left foot, and Ryan Rollins achieved a career-high 20 points. New York, sitting third in the Eastern Conference, dominated Milwaukee in their previous matchups and could potentially meet them in the first playoff round. The Bucks, currently sixth and fighting for home-court advantage, cut the Knicks' lead to just two points in the third quarter, but a significant late-game surge by New York ensured their win. The Knicks capitalized on turnovers, outscoring Milwaukee 26-13 in that area. Both teams are set to play again on Sunday, with the Knicks hosting Portland and the Bucks facing Atlanta.

**Minnesota Timberwolves 124 - 109 Phoenix Suns**  
In an impressive display, Julius Randle led the Minnesota Timberwolves with 25 points in their 124-109 victory over the Phoenix Suns, completing a four-game season sweep. Anthony Edwards added 20 points for the Timberwolves, despite missing the second quarter after a collision with Kevin Durant, who led Phoenix with 23 points. The win marked Minnesota's seventh straight triumph over Phoenix, dating back to last year's postseason. Collin Gillespie's surprising career-high of 22 points and nine assists stood out for the Suns, who were hampered by Bradley Beal's ongoing absence due to a hamstring injury. Devin Booker struggled offensively, posting a season-low 10 points and missing his initial eight shots. The Timberwolves effectively maintained a lead throughout, even while Edwards was sidelined, only returning to receive a standing ovation from the home crowd. Both teams are set to return to the court on Sunday, with Phoenix hosting Houston and Minnesota facing Detroit at home.

**New Orleans Pelicans 95 - 111 Golden State Warriors**  
In his return from a two-game absence due to a pelvic bruise, Stephen Curry scored 23 points to lead the Golden State Warriors to a 111-95 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans. Despite a rough shooting night, making only 7 of 21 shots, Curry hit five key 3-pointers. The Warriors, who now stand at 1-2 in their crucial six-game road trip, also got strong performances from Jimmy Butler with 18 points and Jonathan Kuminga with 16. New Orleans, missing four of their starters, including Zion Williamson, kept competitive in the early stages but faded in the second half. Rookie Yves Missi impressed with his 12th double-double. Buddy Hield’s 4-point play gave Golden State a decisive lead. The Warriors overcame a slow start and managed the game effectively even with Draymond Green fouling out late. Both teams will be back in action on Sunday, with the Warriors facing San Antonio and the Pelicans playing against Charlotte.

**Denver Nuggets 129 - 93 Utah Jazz**  
Nikola Jokic delivered a stellar performance with 27 points and 14 rebounds, helping the Denver Nuggets secure a commanding 129-93 victory against the Utah Jazz, further solidifying their No. 3 seed position in the Western Conference. Denver now sits two games ahead of both the Los Angeles Lakers and Memphis Grizzlies, and trails the Houston Rockets by just 1.5 games for the second seed. Jokic's dominance was evident from the first quarter, where he grabbed 11 rebounds, almost reaching his average of 12.8 per game, before sitting out the fourth quarter. Notably, Jokic made another buzzer-beating shot from beyond the arc to end the first half, reminiscent of his near full-court shot against Sacramento earlier in the year. Meanwhile, Utah struggled without top scorers Lauri Markkanen and John Collins, with Collin Sexton leading the team with 20 points. The Nuggets bolstered their lead with an 11-2 run to close the third quarter and a 25-8 surge to open the fourth. Denver also adapted to Jamal Murray's absence, bringing in Russell Westbrook from the bench and shifting to a bigger lineup. The Jazz are set to continue their road trip in Charlotte, while the Nuggets prepare to face Minnesota at home.
