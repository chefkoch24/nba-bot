**Oklahoma City Thunder 139 - 141 Golden State Warriors**  
In a thrilling game that showcased playoff-caliber intensity early in the season, the Golden State Warriors narrowly defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder 141-139 thanks to a last-second layup by Stephen Curry. The victory marked the Warriors' second straight last-second win, with Dario Saric scoring 20 points and Chris Paul contributing 13 assists with no turnovers. Despite Lu Dort's impressive performance with 29 points and Chet Holmgren's 24 points on 7-for-9 shooting for the Thunder, they fell just short of a signature victory.
