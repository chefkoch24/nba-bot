Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Oklahoma City Thunder with 33 points and 11 rebounds in their 105-92 victory over the Boston Celtics, marking the Thunder's franchise-record 15th consecutive win.

Jayson Tatum contributed 26 points and 10 rebounds for Boston, but the team struggled with their three-point shooting, making only 9 of 46 attempts. Jaylen Brown, meanwhile, was scoreless in the second half, missing all seven shots he attempted. Lu Dort played a crucial role in the fourth quarter, scoring 11 points and hitting three consecutive three-pointers, helping to seal the victory and maintain the Thunder's impressive streak.

**Washington Wizards 98 - 110 New Orleans Pelicans**  
In a matchup between the NBA's bottom two teams, CJ McCollum scored 25 points to lead the New Orleans Pelicans to a 110-98 victory over the Washington Wizards, marking the Pelicans' first back-to-back wins since the start of the season.

McCollum, following a 50-point performance in their previous game, played efficiently by shooting 9 of 18 from the field and 6 of 11 from beyond the arc. Despite a strong showing by Kyle Kuzma with 28 points, the Wizards struggled without Jordan Poole and Bilal Coulibaly, while the Pelicans played without Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram. Highlighting their strong start, the Pelicans went on a 17-point run bridging the first and second quarters, building a lead they maintained throughout.

In a 105-92 victory over the Orlando Magic, Brice Sensabaugh led the Utah Jazz with 27 points, including a stellar 5 of 6 on 3-pointers, coming off the bench.

Despite missing key starters like Lauri Markkanen, John Collins, and Keyonte George, who rested after playing significant minutes the previous night, the Jazz secured two consecutive wins in Florida. Sensabaugh, who had a career-high 34 points the night before in Miami, played a crucial role in the fourth quarter, expanding the Jazz's lead from 11 to 17 points. For the Magic, Jett Howard stood out with a career-high 21 points, while the team struggled without top scorers due to injuries, managing only a 36% field goal percentage.

**Houston Rockets 119 - 115 Los Angeles Lakers**  
In a tightly contested game, the Houston Rockets emerged victorious over the Los Angeles Lakers with a 119-115 win, highlighted by Jalen Green's 33-point performance and a crucial late-game steal by Fred VanVleet. The Rockets, who once led by 22 points, managed to hold off a late Lakers rally, which saw them close the gap to two points with just minutes remaining. Key contributions came from Amen Thompson, who returned from a two-game suspension to achieve a career-high 16 rebounds and 23 points, and from Alperen Sengun, whose missed free throw still left the Rockets with a slim edge. Despite strong efforts from Anthony Davis, who tallied 30 points and 13 rebounds, and LeBron James, who added 21 points and came close to a triple-double, the Lakers fell short. VanVleet's pivotal steal ensured the Rockets' win, emphasizing his impact alongside Houston's 52 points in the paint. James struggled early but ended with 13 rebounds and nine assists, while the Rockets benefited significantly from Thompson's emergent performance in the absence of Jabari Smith Jr.

**Golden State Warriors 99 - 129 Sacramento Kings**  
The Sacramento Kings delivered a commanding performance against the Golden State Warriors, winning 129-99 for their fourth consecutive victory, even in the absence of leading scorer De'Aaron Fox. Malik Monk stood out with 26 points and 12 assists, while Domantas Sabonis added 22 points, 13 rebounds, and seven assists, helping the Kings never trail and build a significant 75-51 lead by halftime. Despite a strong 26-point effort from Stephen Curry, who dazzled with two four-point plays in quick succession, the Warriors were overwhelmed and matched their assists with turnovers, both tallying at 22. Frustration was evident among the home crowd, many of whom left early as Sacramento fans proudly chanted. This game was Sacramento's first at the Chase Center since coach Mike Brown, a former Warriors assistant, was dismissed, with Doug Christie serving as interim coach. The Kings capitalized on shooting momentum, while the Warriors grappled with injuries, including Jonathan Kuminga's sprained ankle, sidelining him for three weeks. Sacramento hosts the Miami Heat next, as the Warriors round off their homestand against the Heat.
