**Columbus Blue Jackets 6 - 2 Pittsburgh Penguins**  
The Columbus Blue Jackets snapped a six-game losing streak with a 6-2 victory over the Pittsburgh Penguins at Nationwide Arena, highlighted by goals and assists from Zach Werenski and Dmitri Voronkov. Columbus harnessed a team effort as Zach Aston-Reese, Mathieu Olivier, Damon Severson, and Cole Sillinger each scored, with Sean Monahan providing two assists. Despite efforts from Anthony Beauvillier, who also netted a goal and an assist, the Penguins suffered their third consecutive loss. Tristan Jarry, recently recalled from the AHL, made 33 saves in his return. Notably, Pittsburgh's regulation defeat to Columbus was their first since November 2019, ending a 13-game streak. Sidney Crosby, aiding Beauvillier's goal, tied Joe Sakic for 13th in NHL history with 1,016 assists, still two goals shy of 600 career goals. This win reinvigorated the Blue Jackets, emphasizing a resilient defensive effort in the third period, as noted by head coach Dean Evason. Meanwhile, Matt Nieto returned to action for the Penguins after knee surgeries, marking his first game since November 2023.

Miromanov gave Calgary a 1-0 lead at 6:38 of the third period. He slid down from the right point and took a pass from MacKenzie Weegar before beating Saros short side over his left shoulder with a snap shot for his first goal in 23 games dating back to April 4, 2024.

Coleman scored into an empty net at 18:51 for the 2-0 final.

Saros and Wolf kept each side at bay through the first 40 minutes of the game.

Wolf made a pad save on Cole Smith's shorthanded breakaway at 11:06 of the first period, and sprawled to deny Steven Stamkos' rebound attempt at the edge of the crease at 7:27 of the second period.

Jonathan Huberdeau hit the crossbar on a shot on a 2-on-1 at 9:03, and Saros made one save, on a Huberdeau wrist shot, as the Predators killed 1:56 of a late-period 5-on-3.
