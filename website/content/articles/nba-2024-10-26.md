**Orlando Magic 116 - 101 Brooklyn Nets**  
In their home opener, the Orlando Magic defeated the Brooklyn Nets 116-101, moving to a 2-0 record for the season. The Magic were led by Franz Wagner's 29 points and his brother Mo Wagner's 18, while Paolo Banchero chipped in with 15 points and nine assists, despite not hitting a field goal in the first half. Wendell Carter contributed with 10 rebounds. For the Nets, Cam Thomas scored 24 points, and Dennis Schroeder added 20. Brooklyn's struggles were highlighted by their 37 turnovers and a free-throw differential of minus-33, contributing to their road difficulties. Despite Ben Simmons giving the Nets a brief lead early in the second half, a 13-0 Orlando run spurred by Franz Wagner's free throws proved decisive, especially as Simmons was sidelined with foul trouble. The Magic's strong bench play and improved three-point shooting, with 33 threes in two games at a 41.8% clip, were key factors in their victory. They have now won eight straight at home dating back to late March, even as they've struggled on the road. The Magic are set to face Memphis next, while the Nets will host Milwaukee for their home opener.

**Toronto Raptors 115 - 107 Philadelphia 76ers**  
The Toronto Raptors ended a seven-game losing streak against the Philadelphia 76ers with a 115-107 victory, as Scottie Barnes led with 27 points and Jakob Poeltl contributed 19. This marked Toronto's first win over Philadelphia since October 2022. Raptors rookie Jamison Battle made a significant impact in the fourth quarter, scoring 10 of his 12 points in rapid succession before fouling out. Fellow rookie Jonathan Mogbo also impressed with 12 points, nine rebounds, and five assists. Toronto dominated the boards, outrebounding the 76ers 54-28. The absence of Joel Embiid, who missed the game due to a sore left knee, was felt as Philadelphia struggled in the paint, being outscored 56-30. Despite strong performances from Kelly Oubre Jr. and Tyrese Maxey, who scored 28 and 24 points respectively, the 76ers remain winless, having also lost to Milwaukee previously. Kyle Lowry, warmly received by Toronto fans, added 14 points against his former team. The Raptors kept their momentum by capitalizing on Battle's nine consecutive points in the fourth quarter to extend a 10-point lead to a game-high 19.

**Atlanta Hawks 125 - 120 Charlotte Hornets**  
In an intense NBA matchup, the Atlanta Hawks edged past the Charlotte Hornets with a 125-120 victory, spearheaded by Trae Young's impressive 38-point performance. Despite LaMelo Ball's remarkable 34-point game, including a career-high nine 3-pointers, Charlotte couldn't capture the lead, though they managed to tie the game twice in the final quarter. The Hornets showcased their depth, even in the absence of starters Brandon Miller and Mark Williams, with Miles Bridges and Tre Mann contributing 27 and 17 points, respectively, and Nick Richards securing a double-double. Young's clutch scoring, particularly a pivotal 3-pointer when the game was tied at 90, helped Atlanta fend off Charlotte's comeback efforts. The game was marked by Ball’s foul troubles, with him fouling out late in the game, underscored by Young’s immediate gesture of raising six fingers. Despite trailing early, the Hornets fought back with a strong second-quarter surge, though ultimately fell short. The Hornets look towards their home opener against Miami, while the Hawks head to Oklahoma City for their next contest.

**Cleveland Cavaliers 113 - 101 Detroit Pistons**  
In their home opener, the Cleveland Cavaliers secured a 113-101 victory over the Detroit Pistons, with Donovan Mitchell and Dean Wade each contributing 19 points. This win marked Cleveland's 10th consecutive victory against Detroit and gave new coach Kenny Atkinson a successful debut at home, leading the Cavs to a 2-0 start. Despite cutting the deficit to eight points in the fourth quarter, the Pistons fell behind as Wade's back-to-back 3-pointers extended Cleveland’s lead. Cade Cunningham led Detroit with 33 points, but his nine turnovers were costly. Ty Jerome made a notable impact off the Cleveland bench, scoring 10 points in just eight minutes, showcasing his resilience after a serious ankle injury last season. The Cavaliers appear strong, adjusting smoothly under Atkinson, while the Pistons, with former Cavs coach J.B. Bickerstaff, who received a mixed reception on his return, continue to show potential but still seek their first victory of the season.

**New York Knicks 123 - 98 Indiana Pacers**  
In their home opener, the New York Knicks rebounded from a heavy defeat in Boston by dominating the Indiana Pacers 123-98, showcasing a balanced performance facilitated by recent trades. Karl-Anthony Towns impressed in his Knicks debut with 21 points and 15 rebounds, while Jalen Brunson led the scoring with 26 points. Mikal Bridges added another 21 points, and Josh Hart contributed a double-double of 20 points and 10 rebounds. The Knicks, evidently strengthened by acquisitions such as Towns and Bridges, effectively spaced the floor and stifled the Pacers' offense, holding them to a dismal 10% shooting from the 3-point line. Despite Indiana's historical offensive prowess, including an NBA playoff record set last season, their All-Star guard Tyrese Haliburton notably struggled, failing to score and missing all seven of his three-point attempts.

**Houston Rockets 128 - 108 Memphis Grizzlies**  
The Houston Rockets secured a decisive 128-108 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies, with Jalen Green leading a balanced attack by contributing 22 points, and six other teammates scoring in double figures. Though trailing 65-59 at halftime, Houston dominated the third quarter with a 39-18 run, fueled by a pivotal 17-0 streak that effectively changed the game’s momentum. This comeback was highlighted by improved 3-point shooting and capitalizing on Memphis' 19 turnovers for 29 points, compared to Memphis’ 13 points from the same number of turnovers. Dillon Brooks, Alperen Sengun, and Fred VanVleet also made significant contributions, while Jabari Smith Jr. added an impressive 14 points and 16 rebounds. The Grizzlies, missing center Jaren Jackson Jr., struggled on the boards with a 64-43 rebounding disadvantage and endured a 4:29 scoring drought during Houston's decisive run. Ja Morant led Memphis with 24 points, but it wasn't enough to stave off a rejuvenated Rockets squad, which avoided a third consecutive 0-2 season start. Both teams have quick turnarounds, with the Grizzlies facing Orlando and the Rockets visiting San Antonio on Saturday night.

**Milwaukee Bucks 122 - 133 Chicago Bulls**  
In an impressive display of shooting, the Chicago Bulls defeated the Milwaukee Bucks 133-122 during Milwaukee's home opener. Coby White led the Bulls with 35 points, closely approaching his career-high, and the team collectively hit 21 out of 47 three-point attempts.

The Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo had a strong performance with 38 points, 11 rebounds, and five assists, while Damian Lillard added 28 points but struggled from beyond the arc. Despite a tightly contested first half and early third-quarter lead exchanges, the Bulls broke a tie and established a decisive lead with a 13-1 run, which included a critical 3-pointer by Patrick Williams. Defensively, the Bucks faltered and missed the support of Khris Middleton, who was out recovering from ankle surgeries. This victory marked Chicago's highest number of three-pointers in a game since February 2021, setting a strong tone ahead of their home opener against the Oklahoma City Thunder.

**Utah Jazz 86 - 127 Golden State Warriors**  
In a dominant performance, the Golden State Warriors defeated the Utah Jazz 127-86 in Salt Lake City, buoyed by Buddy Hield's impressive 27 points and Steph Curry's 20 points. Hield was especially impactful in the first half, scoring 24 points and hitting 6 of 7 three-pointers, as Golden State surged to a 68-32 run from the first to the early third quarter, ultimately improving their record to 2-0. Utah, who shot just 31.5%, struggled under a trapping Warriors defense and fell to 0-2 after initially leading 15-6 in the game. The Jazz's poor shooting continued a trend, as they are now 0-26 in games where they shoot below 33%. Hield's performance was historic as he set an NBA record for the most three-pointers made by a player in their first two games with a new team, successfully converting 12 of 16 attempts. Meanwhile, Curry and the starters were able to rest in the fourth quarter of this second consecutive blowout win, as the Warriors look ahead to a matchup against the Los Angeles Clippers.

**Los Angeles Lakers 123 - 116 Phoenix Suns**  
In an impressive comeback, the Los Angeles Lakers overturned a 22-point deficit to defeat the Phoenix Suns 123-116, marking their first 2-0 start since the 2010-11 season. Anthony Davis led the charge with 35 points, while Austin Reaves contributed 26 points. LeBron James, scoring 17 out of his total 21 points in the second half, played a crucial role in rallying the team, particularly in the third quarter where the Lakers outscored the Suns 35-24. Notably, the Suns commanded an early lead behind Kevin Durant's 30 points and Devin Booker's 23. However, their shooting waned after a strong start, hitting only 9 of 27 shots in the third quarter. Lakers coach JJ Reddick achieved a significant milestone by becoming the first coach since Phil Jackson in 1999 to win his first two games with the team. The Lakers capitalized on a 20-6 run spanning late in the third quarter to early in the fourth, sealing the victory. Both team’s three-point shooting proved pivotal, with Reaves hitting 5 of 7, while the team collectively went 14 of 27 from beyond the arc. Both teams are slated to continue their campaigns with home games the following night, as the Suns host Dallas and the Lakers face Sacramento.
