**Orlando Magic 85 - 108 New York Knicks**  
The New York Knicks extended their winning streak to six games with a decisive 108-85 victory over the Orlando Magic, driven by Jalen Brunson's 26 points and nine assists, as well as Josh Hart's double-double of 23 points and 13 rebounds. The Knicks, also benefitting from Karl-Anthony Towns' contribution of 16 points and eight rebounds, pulled away in the second half, particularly after Jalen Suggs of the Magic, who was limited to 26 minutes due to foul trouble, had to leave the game when it was tied at 63. By the time Suggs returned, the Knicks had taken a commanding 17-point lead. The Magic struggled with a 36.8% shooting performance, and their injury-plagued lineup couldn't counteract the Knicks' strong defense and 44-32 rebound advantage. Despite the Knicks hitting just 4 of 15 from beyond the arc, they compensated with efficient 54% shooting overall and a solid performance from the free-throw line. This marks the Magic's fifth loss in seven games, highlighting their ongoing challenges this season.

**Boston Celtics 142 - 105 Indiana Pacers**  
In a dominant performance, Jaylen Brown scored a season-high 44 points, including six 3-pointers, as the Boston Celtics defeated the Indiana Pacers 142-105, ending a two-game losing streak. Brown's impressive night also featured four steals, joining Larry Bird and Antoine Walker as the only Celtics to achieve at least 44 points and four steals in a game. Jayson Tatum contributed with 22 points and 13 rebounds while Payton Pritchard nearly secured a triple-double with 18 points, 10 assists, and 8 rebounds. Despite playing without Kristaps Porzingis and Jrue Holiday due to injuries, Boston thrived defensively, limiting Indiana to 28% from three-point range and racking up nine steals. Al Horford highlighted Boston's pivotal 13-0 run with consecutive 3-pointers. The win prevented the Celtics' first three-game losing streak of the season, while the Pacers, missing key players such as Obi Toppin and Andrew Nembhard, lost their second consecutive game after a five-game winning streak. The two teams will face off again on Sunday in their last regular-season matchup.

**Brooklyn Nets 87 - 96 San Antonio Spurs**  
The San Antonio Spurs triumphed over the Brooklyn Nets, 96-87, in a game marked by Victor Wembanyama's stellar performance with 19 points, seven rebounds, and six blocks. Despite a poor first-half shooting performance, the Spurs rebounded by hitting 56.7% of their shots in the second half, with Wembanyama scoring 11 points in the third quarter during a decisive 22-9 run that turned their fortune from a deficit to a lead. Jeremy Sochan contributed a double-double with 12 points and 14 rebounds, while Julian Champagnie and Keldon Johnson added 18 and 15 points, respectively, to end San Antonioâ€™s two-game losing streak. Brooklyn, missing key players Cam Johnson and Ben Simmons, struggled offensively with Keon Johnson scoring a game-high 25 points and Shake Milton adding 16 points and 12 assists. The Nets, plagued by numerous defeats recently, found their offense stagnant, leading to their ninth loss in 12 games. Interestingly, Wembanyama continued two streaks: recording at least four blocks for the fifth straight game and achieving at least one 3-pointer and one block for the 22nd consecutive game.

**Houston Rockets 112 - 113 Minnesota Timberwolves**  
The Minnesota Timberwolves staged a dramatic comeback to defeat the Houston Rockets 113-112, with Anthony Edwards hitting a decisive step-back 3-pointer with 23 seconds remaining. Down by 12 points with just three minutes left, the Timberwolves mounted a thrilling 10-0 run that included a crucial 3-point play by Edwards, trimming the deficit to 110-108 with 1:30 remaining. Despite Alperen Sengun's efforts, scoring a season-high 38 points and grabbing 12 rebounds, his missed free throws left the door open. Julius Randle contributed significantly with 27 points while Edwards, who had only one point in the second half before his clutch shot, finished with 24 points to secure their second consecutive victory. Fred VanVleet's missed 3-pointer sealed the Rockets' fate, ending their four-game winning streak. The Timberwolves overcame being outscored 66-40 in the paint and now prepare to host San Antonio, while the Rockets will face Miami next.

**New Orleans Pelicans 124 - 132 Memphis Grizzlies**  
The Memphis Grizzlies secured a 132-124 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans, never trailing throughout the game. Jaren Jackson Jr. led the Grizzlies with 33 points, while Ja Morant contributed 25 before leaving with a minor shoulder injury after being hit by a hard screen from Daniel Theis. Despite Morant's early exit, he provided support from the bench as Desmond Bane added 18 points and Scottie Pippen Jr. scored 13. The Pelicans, struggling with a nine-game losing streak and the absence of key players like Brandon Ingram and Zion Williamson, saw a strong performance from Trey Murphy III with 35 points and CJ McCollum with 32, but it was not enough. Memphis, coming off a record 155-point game against Toronto, relied on Jackson to thwart a Pelicans comeback as he sparked an 8-0 run in the third quarter. The Grizzlies demonstrated their shooting prowess by going 17 of 41 from beyond the arc, contrasting with New Orleans' 28.9% success rate from three-point range.

**Denver Nuggets 135 - 149 Cleveland Cavaliers**  
The Cleveland Cavaliers secured their sixth consecutive victory by defeating the Denver Nuggets 149-135, marking a season-high in points for the Cavs. Donovan Mitchell led the charge with 33 points, while Evan Mobley added 26, contributing to Cleveland's impressive 10-1 record since a two-game losing streak to Atlanta. Despite a standout performance from Nikola Jokic, who secured his league-leading 12th triple-double with 27 points, 14 rebounds, and 13 assists, the Nuggets couldn't overcome their defensive struggles, exacerbated by Aaron Gordon's absence. Cleveland's dominance was highlighted by a 16-0 run during the game, spurred by Darius Garland, which established a secure lead. The Cavs displayed impressive shooting efficiency, with all starters, except Dean Wade, scoring 20 or more points. Meanwhile, Michael Porter Jr. started strong for the Nuggets, but his contribution dwindled as the game progressed. The Cavaliers are set to continue their challenging road trip against Golden State next, while the Nuggets face Detroit.

**Phoenix Suns 89 - 98 Dallas Mavericks**  
In a resilient performance, the Dallas Mavericks secured a 98-89 victory over the Phoenix Suns, succeeding without injured star Luka Doncic. Kyrie Irving led the charge with 20 points, while Daniel Gafford contributed 16. Despite a brawl in the third quarter that led to the ejection of forwards Naji Marshall and P.J. Washington, as well as Phoenix's Jusuf Nurkic, the Mavericks maintained their composure. Interestingly, Dallas never trailed, achieving an 18-point lead at one stage, and held a 55-39 advantage by halftime with Irving's key three-point shooting. Kevin Durant's 35-point effort wasn't enough for the struggling Suns, now with four losses in five games and struggling without Devin Booker. Dallas' strategic balance on both ends of the floor proved crucial, exemplifying how teams can still excel despite missing their stars, a lesson Phoenix is finding hard to emulate with their deteriorating form.

**LA Clippers 102 - 92 Golden State Warriors**  
In a key matchup between the Los Angeles Clippers and the Golden State Warriors, player availability took center stage. The Clippers are eagerly awaiting Kawhi Leonard's return, but he won't play due to ongoing knee issues, while the Warriors opted to rest Stephen Curry ahead of a back-to-back game against the Phoenix Suns. The Clippers have been on an upswing, winning three of their last four games, highlighted by a narrow 114-110 victory against the Memphis Grizzlies, where Norman Powell led with 29 points and James Harden had a near triple-double. The Clippers' collective defensive effort held Memphis to well below their scoring average, a testament to coach Tyronn Lue's team-first philosophy. Meanwhile, Stephen Curry's late-game heroics couldn't rescue the Warriors in a recent loss; despite scoring 38 points and nearly forcing an overtime, Golden State has been in a slump, losing five of their last six games. Curry emphasized urgency in a players-only meeting, underscoring the need for renewed momentum before the All-Star break.
