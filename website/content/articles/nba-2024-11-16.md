**Indiana Pacers 111 - 124 Miami Heat**  
The Miami Heat secured a 124-111 victory over the Indiana Pacers in NBA Cup play, thanks largely to Bam Adebayo's commanding performance with 30 points and 11 rebounds, including 17 points in the decisive final quarter. Miami's Tyler Herro and Kevin Love also contributed significantly, with 20 and 15 points respectively. Notably, Love ignited the second half by scoring the team's first 13 points, helping establish a lead that ballooned to 22 points. This win was crucial for the Heat, serving as a rebound from a tough overtime loss earlier in the week marred by a tactical error. On Indiana's side, Obi Toppin led with 21 points from the bench, while Tyrese Haliburton added 18 points and eight assists. Despite Indiana's offensive capabilities, defensive lapses continued to plague the team, allowing the Heat an advantage in both scoring and free throw opportunities. The two teams are set to face off again on Sunday in Indianapolis.

**Orlando Magic 98 - 86 Philadelphia 76ers**  
In an NBA Cup game in Orlando, Franz Wagner led the Magic to a 98-86 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers, scoring 31 points with 11 rebounds.

The Magic, commanding at home with a 14-game winning streak, are now 2-0 in NBA Cup Group A play, while the 76ers, missing their full star trio for much of the season, are 0-2, struggling in the Eastern Conference standings.

Dyson Daniels shone with 25 points and six steals, leading the Atlanta Hawks to a 129-117 victory over the Washington Wizards, marking their second consecutive win in the NBA Cup. The Hawks, paced by Jalen Johnson's double-double and Trae Young's near double-double performance, overcame an early deficit with a dominant 30-11 second quarter run. Young reached a career milestone, recording his 4,000th assist early in the third quarter. Despite strong performances from Kyle Kuzma, Jordan Poole, and rookie Alex Sarr, who scored a career-high 20 points, the Wizards suffered their seventh straight loss.

**Cleveland Cavaliers 144 - 126 Chicago Bulls**  
The Cleveland Cavaliers extended their remarkable unbeaten streak to 14 games, setting a franchise record for the best start in club history with a 144-126 victory over the Chicago Bulls in an NBA Cup game. Donovan Mitchell led the way with a season-high 37 points, while Darius Garland contributed 29, and Jarrett Allen added 24 points. The win makes the Cavs the sixth team in league history to start 14-0, a feat not achieved since the Golden State Warriors' 24-0 start in the 2015-16 season. Under first-year coach Kenny Atkinson, the Cavs have showcased energy and strong team dynamics, even winning without starting forward Evan Mobley, who was sidelined due to illness. Despite the Bulls staying competitive until the final minutes, Cleveland pulled away with key 3-pointers from Caris LeVert and Mitchell, adding to an explosive first quarter where the team scored 49 points.

**New York Knicks 124 - 122 Brooklyn Nets**  
Jalen Brunson delivered a crucial 3-pointer with 6.2 seconds left to secure a 124-122 win for the New York Knicks over the Brooklyn Nets, despite the Knicks previously squandering a 21-point lead. Brunson, who missed a potential game-winner against Chicago, redeemed himself by finishing with 37 points in this victory, contributing significantly to the Knicks' 2-0 record in the NBA Cup. OG Anunoby added 25 points, and Mikal Bridges, facing his former team, scored 22 and partially blocked a layup attempt on the last play. The Nets, without key standing plays from Karl-Anthony Towns and Nic Claxton, saw Cam Thomas achieve a season-high 43 points, marking his ninth career 40-point game. Although the Knicks were outrebounded, the win gave them the edge in the historic rivalry with the Nets. The game also featured a pivotal moment when a challenge by Nets coach Jordi Fernandez overturned a call against Dorian Finney-Smith, affecting Anunoby's fouling out with 4:15 remaining. The teams are set to rematch on Sunday.

**San Antonio Spurs 115 - 120 Los Angeles Lakers**  
In an intense NBA matchup, Anthony Davis propelled the Los Angeles Lakers to a 120-115 win over the San Antonio Spurs, scoring a season-high 40 points and grabbing 12 rebounds. LeBron James recorded his fourth consecutive triple-double with 15 points, 16 rebounds, and 12 assists, marking his career-high feat in this statistic. Despite the loss, San Antonio's Victor Wembanyama impressed with 28 points and 14 rebounds, following his notable 50-point performance earlier in the week. An early 11-0 lead by the Spurs quickly dissipated as Los Angeles closed the first quarter on a 21-8 run. A crucial offensive foul on Chris Paul, who reached a career milestone of 12,008 assists, led to a pivotal turnover, allowing the Lakers to secure the win with a late-game layup by James. This victory sets up the Lakers for a back-to-back encounter in New Orleans, while the Spurs head to Dallas before starting a homestand.

This victory marked Houston's fourth consecutive win and their second straight triumph over the Clippers, following a 111-103 victory earlier in the week. The Rockets maintained control throughout, with a decisive third-quarter surge widening their lead to 19 points entering the final period.

James Harden scored 21 points for the Clippers and tied Ray Allen for second-most career 3-pointers at 2,973, behind Stephen Curry.

**New Orleans Pelicans 101 - 94 Denver Nuggets**  
Brandon Ingram's 29-point performance was pivotal in leading the New Orleans Pelicans to a 101-94 victory over the Denver Nuggets, snapping the Pelicans' six-game losing streak and halting the Nuggets' five-game winning run. Despite twisting his ankle in the second half, Ingram, along with Brandon Boston Jr. and Trey Murphy III who scored 19 and 17 points respectively, lifted an injury-plagued New Orleans team. The Nuggets, missing three-time MVP Nikola Jokic due to personal reasons, struggled from the perimeter, converting only 10 of 37 three-point attempts. Led by Michael Porter Jr.'s 24 points, Denver couldn't capitalize on its usual 40.4% 3-point shooting efficiency. Russell Westbrook's late three-pointer closed the gap to 87-86, but the Pelicans responded with eight unanswered points, securing their win. With Michael Malone absent to support his daughter at a state volleyball playoff, assistant coach David Adelman led Denver.

**Oklahoma City Thunder 99 - 83 Phoenix Suns**  
In a commanding performance, the Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the short-handed Phoenix Suns 99-83 in an NBA Cup game, extending their winning streak to three games. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the way with 28 points, while Lu Dort added 15 points and nine rebounds. Despite missing injured center Chet Holmgren, Oklahoma City dominated, leading by as much as 25 points in the second half. The Suns, playing without key players Kevin Durant, Bradley Beal, and Grayson Allen, struggled offensively, with Devin Booker hitting only 2 of 10 shots for a total of 12 points. Oklahoma City improved to an impressive 11-2 record, while Phoenix fell to 9-4. The Thunder's aggressive rebounding and strong defense kept the Suns at bay, ensuring the lead was never seriously threatened after Phoenix briefly narrowed the gap in the second quarter. The game set the stage for the Thunder's upcoming match against Dallas, while the Suns are slated to play Minnesota.

**Golden State Warriors 123 - 118 Memphis Grizzlies**  
In an NBA Cup game, the Memphis Grizzlies faced off against the Golden State Warriors in San Francisco, marking the Grizzlies’ first appearance in the season's in-season tournament. Despite the absence of key players like Ja Morant and GG Jackson II, and with Desmond Bane's return uncertain, the Grizzlies have been putting up impressive scores, winning three of their last four games, although they tied a season-high by conceding 128 points in their recent loss to the Lakers. Coach Taylor Jenkins emphasized the need for a stronger start on the road, after Memphis allowed 38 first-quarter points against Los Angeles. Conversely, the Warriors seek their second consecutive home win after narrowly defeating the Mavericks 120-117, with Klay Thompson back on the court. However, they are dealing with De'Anthony Melton's injury, who sprained his left ACL following a strong comeback performance. Warriors coach Steve Kerr highlighted Melton’s role and remains uncertain about his replacement, considering players like Buddy Hield and Jonathan Kuminga. Both teams have been performing at a high scoring pace, with Golden State unbeaten in seven games where they scored 120 or more points.

**Sacramento Kings 126 - 130 Minnesota Timberwolves**  
In an NBA Cup group stage matchup, the Sacramento Kings defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 106-98 despite an impressive 60-point effort from Timberwolves' star Anthony Edwards, who went 0-for-9 from three-point range. Minnesota, grappling with early-season struggles, was without their starting point guard, Mike Conley, due to rest. The Wolves have been working on integrating Julius Randle and Donte DiVincenzo following their acquisition from the New York Knicks, a process that remains challenging as the team seeks to overcome inefficiencies. Meanwhile, the Kings capitalized on their improved three-point shooting, having gone 15-of-28 from beyond the arc, a stark contrast to their previous struggles this season. De'Aaron Fox led Sacramento with 29 points, six rebounds, and ten assists, while Keegan Murray was lauded for his defensive efforts in limiting Suns star Devin Booker's impact in their last game. Sacramento is also dealing with injury concerns as guard DeMar DeRozan is listed as doubtful due to lower back tightness. The Kings are looking to build on this victory and avenge an earlier loss to Minnesota, where the Timberwolves narrowly won 117-115.
