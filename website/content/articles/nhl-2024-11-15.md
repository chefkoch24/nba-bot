**Buffalo Sabres 4 - 3 St Louis Blues**  
Rasmus Dahlin secured a dramatic 4-3 overtime win for the Buffalo Sabres against the St. Louis Blues with a decisive power-play goal. The power play resulted from a late-period interference penalty on Blues’ Justin Faulk against Sabres goalie Devon Levi. Dahlin, receiving a cross-ice pass from JJ Peterka, fired a one-timer from the right face-off circle. Buffalo’s Alex Tuch had earlier tied the game 3-3 in the third after the Blues took the lead twice, notably through Brandon Saad's two goals, ending his nine-game scoring drought. Ryan McLeod contributed with a goal and an assist, and goalie Devon Levi made 24 saves for the Sabres, who have now won four of their last five games. The Blues, despite contributions from Brayden Schenn and Pavel Buchnevich, are on a four-game losing streak. Injuries marred the game as Blues defenseman Pierre-Olivier Joseph exited early with a lower-body injury. Dahlin’s goal marked his 70th in the NHL, making him the third defenseman in Sabres history to reach this milestone, highlighting his significant contribution to the team’s offensive capability.

**Minnesota Wild 3 - 0 Montreal Canadiens**  
Kaprizov has goal, assist, Wild shut out Canadiens
 **ST. PAUL, Minn.** \-\- <forge-entity title="Kirill Kaprizov" slug="kirill-kaprizov-8478864" code="player">Kirill Kaprizov</forge-entity> had a goal and an assist, and <forge-entity title="Filip Gustavsson" slug="filip-gustavsson-8479406" code="player">Filip Gustavsson</forge-entity> made 19 saves for the Minnesota Wild in a 3-0 win against the Montreal Canadiens at Xcel Energy Center on Thursday. 
The shutout was Gustavsson’s first of the season and his seventh in the NHL.

“No 2-on-1s or 3-on-2s that I can think of that were really clear,” Gustavsson said. “They had one chance, their second shot to the game, on the glove side there. That was maybe their best chance all game. We played really solid. We took some penalties, killed them off, and played good."

<forge-entity title="Matt Boldy" slug="matt-boldy-8481557" code="player">Matt Boldy</forge-entity> and <forge-entity title="Marco Rossi" slug="marco-rossi-8482079" code="player">Marco Rossi</forge-entity> scored for the Wild (11-2-3), who have won six of their past eight games.

“I thought the effort was really good,” Minnesota coach John Hynes said. “I thought we had a really good start to the game as well. Both teams looked like they were ready to play …We defended hard when we had to. I thought the third period we regathered ourselves with our puck management.” 
<forge-entity title="Sam Montembeault" slug="sam-montembeault-8478470" code="player">Sam Montembeault</forge-entity> made 25 saves for the Canadiens (5-10-2), who have lost seven of eight.

“I felt we were very patient and there was not much room for either team,” Montreal coach Martin St. Louis said. “It wasn't an offensive -- it wasn't a track meet. Both teams were playing tight defensively and, to me, it's a really good sign of where we're heading with our club.”

Boldy gave the Wild a 1-0 lead at 12:43 of the second period with his 10th goal of the season. Kaprizov found Marcus Johansson in the low slot, and he redirected the puck to Boldy for a one-timer off the crossbar and in.

“I didn't do much there,” Boldy said. “So, it was pretty good just to catch it and shoot it in the net.”

Canadiens defenseman Jayden Struble was assessed a four-minute high-sticking minor on Wild defenseman Jared Spurgeon at 8:22 of the third period.

Rossi made it 2-0 at 12:19 with three seconds left on the power play with a wrist shot through traffic after faking a shot and moving inside.

“The special teams were huge,” Rossi said. “The PK was really strong today and (on) the power play we had a good strong goal.” 
With Montembeault pulled for the extra attacker, Kaprizov scored into an empty net at 19:40 for the 3-0 final.

“I think it was a good effort,” Montreal defenseman Mike Matheson said. “Against teams like that, it doesn't take a lot for them to be able to separate. So, I think for the most part, we did a good job of not giving them a lot. And I think the difference, if you look back at the chances, I think we had some really good chances to score and we didn't score ours and they scored theirs.”

**NOTES:** Minnesota forwards Mats Zuccarello and Joel Eriksson Ek each left during the first period with lower-body injuries. Zuccarello took a Brock Faber shot to the stomach at 12:52. It was undetermined which play Eriksson Ek was injured on as he exited toward the end of the period. There was no update on either player. …Boldy has eight goals in his past 11 games.

McDavid, who is now the fourth fastest player in NHL history to reach this milestone, delivered both a crucial goal and a skillful assist. His historic point came during the second period, where a seamless play with Leon Draisaitl resulted in a one-timer that tied the game. Darnell Nurse also shone with two goals, including the game-winner assisted by McDavid's no-look backhand pass. The Oilers secured their third consecutive win, while the Predators, with goals from Michael McCarron and Cole Smith, suffered their fifth loss in six games.

**Vancouver Canucks 2 - 5 New York Islanders**
