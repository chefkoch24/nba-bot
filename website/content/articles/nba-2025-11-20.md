**Minnesota Timberwolves 120 - 109 Washington Wizards**  
In a thrilling game, Julius Randle led the Minnesota Timberwolves to a 120-109 victory over the Washington Wizards with a standout performance of 32 points and 10 rebounds.

Naz Reid contributed significantly with 28 points off the bench. The Wizards, who have now lost 12 consecutive games, narrowed a 27-point deficit to just five at one point, thanks in part to Kyshawn George's 23 points. However, Minnesota maintained their lead, with Randle's critical plays and a clutch 3-pointer from Donte DiVincenzo sealing the victory.
