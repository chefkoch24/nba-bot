The Orlando Magic surged past the Washington Wizards with a 110-90 victory in Orlando, powered by Franz Wagner and rookie Anthony Black, who each scored 23 points. Black shone particularly in the second half, where he netted 18 of his career-high points.

Kevin Durant had a challenging night, shooting 5 for 15 overall and 0 for 5 from 3-point range. Notably, the Suns trimmed a 19-point deficit to just two points in the final minutes, thanks in part to Greyson Allen's 3-pointer, but the Raptors sealed the victory with clutch 3-point shots from Boucher and Quickley.
