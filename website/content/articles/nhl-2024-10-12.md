**Carolina Hurricanes 1 - 4 Tampa Bay Lightning**  
In an impressive season opener, Nikita Kucherov led the Tampa Bay Lightning to a 4-1 victory over the Carolina Hurricanes with a natural hat trick in the third period, including two empty-net goals. Kucherov also added an assist, becoming the third player in Lightning history to record four points in a season-opening game. This extends his franchise points to 877, placing him third behind Steven Stamkos and Martin St. Louis. The game marked Kucherov's sixth NHL hat trick, contributing to an effective power-play performance by Tampa Bay. The Lightning were previously evacuated to Raleigh due to Hurricane Milton. Newcomer Jake Guentzel made his debut with two assists after joining the Lightning from the Hurricanes, while Andrei Vasilevskiy solidified the win with 20 saves. Despite Jordan Staal giving the Hurricanes an early lead, Carolina struggled to generate offense, a point of criticism by coach Rod Brind’Amour.

**Winnipeg Jets 2 - 1 Chicago Blackhawks**  
Mark Scheifele delivered a thrilling performance for the Winnipeg Jets by scoring both the tying goal and overtime winner in their 2-1 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks. With just over a minute left in regulation, Scheifele evened the score by capitalizing on a rebound, and then secured the win only 38 seconds into overtime. This dramatic finish not only marked the Jets' victorious home opener but also cemented Scheifele as the second player in franchise history to reach 300 goals, alongside Ilya Kovalchuk. The game highlighted goaltender Connor Hellebuyck's resilience, whose shutout streak ended at 96:51 minutes, yet his 25 saves were crucial. Meanwhile, Soderblom impressed with 33 saves for the Blackhawks, and Ryan Donato scored their lone goal. Despite near-full game effort, defensive lapses in the final moments cost the Blackhawks, emphasizing the need for complete 60-minute performances as noted by Chicago players and coaches.
