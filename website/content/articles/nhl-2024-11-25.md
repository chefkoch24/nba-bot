**Toronto Maple Leafs 3 - 2 Utah Hockey Club**  
The Toronto Maple Leafs edged out the Utah Hockey Club 3-2 at Scotiabank Arena, marking their fourth consecutive victory. Mitch Marner was a standout performer, scoring twice, extending his point streak to eight with a total of four goals and four assists during this run. Playing without their captain Auston Matthews, who is out with an injury, the Maple Leafs showcased their depth and resilience. William Nylander also contributed a goal and an assist, while Joseph Woll made 23 crucial saves to maintain the lead. Utah's Logan Cooley scored and assisted, but the team struggled with penalties in the second period, despite a promising performance in their previous game against the Pittsburgh Penguins. Jack McBain attempted a late comeback for Utah, but Woll's sharp goaltending, particularly against Michael Carcone, ensured Toronto's win. The game also featured Alex Nylander making his season debut alongside his brother William, marking a unique moment for the Maple Leafs as they became the fifth pair of brothers to play together for the team.
