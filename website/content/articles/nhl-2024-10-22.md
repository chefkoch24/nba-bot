**Toronto Maple Leafs 5 - 2 Tampa Bay Lightning**  
In a dynamic performance, William Nylander shone with two goals and an assist as the Toronto Maple Leafs defeated the Tampa Bay Lightning 5-2 at Scotiabank Arena. Nylander opened the scoring and propelled the Leafs with playmaking that included setting Auston Matthews up to extend his goal streak to three games. The Leafs capitalized on Lightning errors, including goals by Max Pacioretty and Matthew Knies, while Anthony Stolarz fortified Torontoâ€™s defense with 32 crucial saves. Despite a power-play goal by Brayden Point, Tampa could not recover after Andrei Vasilevskiy was pulled for allowing four goals. Notably, this loss marked one of the few instances coach Jon Cooper had to remove Vasilevskiy mid-game. With critical moments like Stolarz's sprawling save and Knies' deft breakaway, the Leafs secured their fourth win in five games, leaving the Lightning to regroup after back-to-back defeats.
