**Atlanta Hawks 120 - 110 Miami Heat**  
In an impressive finish to their four-game homestand, the Atlanta Hawks triumphed over the Miami Heat with a 120-110 victory, marking their third consecutive win. Jalen Johnson led the Hawks with 28 points, continuing his scoring spree nearly reaching his career-high, while Trae Young contributed his 22nd double-double of the season, narrowly missing a franchise assist record. De'Andre Hunter added strength from the bench, extending his double-digit scoring streak. Despite the absence of Jimmy Butler, Miami saw strong performances from Tyler Herro and Bam Adebayo but struggled to overcome the Hawks' superior shooting efficiency. The game remained tight in the first half but turned in Atlanta's favor in the third quarter after key three-pointers from Garrison Mathews and Hunter. The Hawks now face a six-game road journey starting in Toronto, whereas the Heat will visit the Rockets.

**Charlotte Hornets 94 - 106 Oklahoma City Thunder**  
The Oklahoma City Thunder secured their 10th consecutive regular-season win by defeating the Charlotte Hornets 106-94 in Charlotte, despite missing key starters Luguentz Dort and Cason Wallace. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Jalen Williams led the charge, scoring 22 and 20 points respectively, while Aaron Wiggins and Isaiah Hartenstein contributed significantly, with Hartenstein also grabbing 15 rebounds. The Thunder maintained control throughout the game, never trailing, and stretched their halftime lead to a commanding 20 points in the third quarter. The injury-plagued Hornets, missing LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller, suffered their 15th loss in 16 games. Although Vasa Micic and Miles Bridges tried to keep Charlotte competitive, the Hornets struggled offensively, with Bridges hitting just 1 of 8 three-pointers. Kenrich Williams' timely layup off a pass from Ajay Mitchell ensured that Charlotte's late comeback hopes were dashed. Looking ahead, the Thunder face the Grizzlies in a grueling back-to-back, while the Hornets aim to rebound against the Bulls.

Jalen Brunson delivered a stellar performance, scoring a season-high 55 points to lead the New York Knicks to a thrilling 136-132 overtime victory against the Washington Wizards, extending their winning streak to seven games.

Jonathan Kuminga's stellar performance, scoring 34 points and making the decisive free throws, propelled the Golden State Warriors to a 109-105 victory over the Phoenix Suns in San Francisco. Kuminga's crucial plays tied his career-high points, just a day after setting the record against the Clippers, and were pivotal as the Warriors overcame a one-point deficit against Kevin Durant's 31-point effort for the Suns. The Warriors' defense was instrumental, holding Phoenix without a field goal for the final 6:48 of the game, aiding their fourth-quarter comeback. Stephen Curry contributed with 22 points, including an impressive one-handed floater to close the first half. Both teams faced adversity: Phoenix played without Jusuf Nurkic due to suspension, and Royce O’Neale exited with an injury, while the Warriors coped with Brandin Podziemski's absence in the second half. The win marked a critical start to a six-game homestand for the Warriors, who had previously lost six of seven games.

Despite a spirited comeback by Detroit, featuring Cade Cunningham and Jaden Ivey each scoring 17 points, the Nuggets held firm. A critical moment saw Ronald Holland narrow the gap to 128-121, but Jokić's decisive six consecutive points sealed the game. The victory came just a day after Denver's defense tightened up, recovering from a previous loss to Cleveland where they conceded 149 points. The win puts Denver at an impressive 6-0 record on the second game of back-to-back sets, while Detroit concluded their road trip on a mixed note, having previously defeated Phoenix, the Los Angeles Lakers, and Sacramento.

In their upcoming game against the Utah Jazz, the Philadelphia 76ers are riding a wave of improved performance, highlighted by a recent 118-114 victory over the Boston Celtics, marking their eighth win in the last 11 games.

Maxey emphasized the team's evolution from the bottom of the Eastern Conference, crediting their improved chemistry with several new additions. This marks a significant turnaround since their November 27 loss to the Houston Rockets, with key players like Embiid, Maxey, and Paul George now finally playing together.

**Portland Trail Blazers 126 - 122 Dallas Mavericks**  
Despite being without star player Luka Doncic due to a calf strain, the Dallas Mavericks have proved resilient, aiming for an 8-2 record in his absence as they face the Portland Trail Blazers. The Mavericks, who previously defeated Portland 132-108, are coming off a 98-89 victory over the Phoenix Suns, with Kyrie Irving leading a balanced team effort, though he struggled with shooting. Dallas' coach Jason Kidd has emphasized a "next-man-up" mentality amid multiple suspensions and injuries, notably forwards Naji Marshall and P.J. Washington following an altercation with Jusuf Nurkic, who was also penalized. Conversely, the Trail Blazers recently broke a losing streak with a thrilling 122-120 win over the Utah Jazz, highlighted by Scoot Henderson's clutch scoring and Deni Avdija’s standout performance, although Avdija might miss the upcoming game due to back soreness. Meanwhile, Portland coach Chauncey Billups will miss another game for personal reasons, with assistant Nate Bjorkgren taking over coaching duties.

**Los Angeles Lakers 132 - 122 Sacramento Kings**  
LeBron James continues to lead a resurgent Los Angeles Lakers ahead of their Saturday showdown with the struggling Sacramento Kings, who are undergoing a coaching change after Mike Brown's firing. James, nearing his 40th birthday, recently spearheaded the Lakers to a 115-113 victory over the Golden State Warriors, contributing 31 points and 10 assists despite the absence of Anthony Davis due to an injury. Austin Reaves delivered a crucial triple-double performance with a game-winning layup against the Warriors. With Davis' status uncertain for the upcoming game, the Lakers may also see the return of guard D'Angelo Russell, while James and Rui Hachimura are battling illness. Sacramento, under interim coach Doug Christie, faces challenges after a narrow 114-113 defeat to the Detroit Pistons, partly due to late-game inconsistencies. The Kings have now embarked on a five-game losing streak, highlighting their defensive struggles and contributing to Brown's dismissal. As they prepare to face the Lakers, Sacramento must address issues that have plagued them throughout the season.
