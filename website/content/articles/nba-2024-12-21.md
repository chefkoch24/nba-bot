**Philadelphia 76ers 108 - 98 Charlotte Hornets**  
In an exhilarating night, Joel Embiid scored 34 points and provided nine assists while donning a "Phantom of the Opera" mask to lead the Philadelphia 76ers to a 108-98 victory over the Charlotte Hornets. This win, their fourth in five games, helps the 76ers inch closer to a potential play-in tournament despite their 9-16 record. Embiid, hampered by injuries and missing many games this season, still showcased his prowess. Tyrese Maxey contributed 23 points, aiding Philadelphia's strong first-quarter performance, during which they attained an 18-point lead with a 56% shooting percentage. This game marked only the fourth time the 76ers' star trio of Embiid, Maxey, and Paul George started together this season. The Hornets, led by Vasilije Micic's 20 points, suffered their fourth consecutive loss, with LaMelo Ball sitting out to manage a calf injury.

The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Milwaukee Bucks 124-101, marking their 15th home victory this season and improving their league-best record to 24-4. Donovan Mitchell led Cleveland with 27 points, while Darius Garland added 16. The Cavaliers' dominance included sinking 20 three-pointers and extending their season advantage to 3-0 over the Bucks. Milwaukee, fresh off their NBA Cup win, struggled without star guard Damian Lillard due to a calf strain, missing his 25.7 points per game contribution. Giannis Antetokounmpo, named MVP of the NBA Cup, shone for the Bucks with 33 points and 14 rebounds. Notably, the Bucksâ€™ starting guards, Andre Jackson Jr. and AJ Green, missed all nine of their combined shot attempts. The game also marked Max Strus's return from an ankle injury for the Cavaliers. Bucks' coach Doc Rivers highlighted the tight schedule post-tournament and anticipates more recovery time in future league events. Both teams face back-to-back challenges, with the Bucks hosting Washington and the Cavaliers facing Philadelphia next.

**Miami Heat 97 - 104 Oklahoma City Thunder**  
The Oklahoma City Thunder secured their seventh consecutive victory by defeating the Miami Heat 104-97, with Jalen Williams leading the way with a season-high 33 points and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander adding 25. The Thunder's win streak remains unbroken as the NBA Cup final loss to Milwaukee is not counted as a regular-season game. Oklahoma City, now with a 22-5 record, stands second-best in the NBA and first in the Western Conference. Lu Dort and Isaiah Hartenstein made significant contributions, the latter pulling down 18 rebounds. The Thunder capitalized on the Heat's errors, converting 19 turnovers into 27 points, which played a crucial role in the outcome. Miami's Tyler Herro scored 28 points, but the Heat faced challenges losing Jimmy Butler early due to illness and briefly losing Bam Adebayo, who returned after receiving stitches from an accidental elbow by a teammate. The win also marked Gilgeous-Alexander's impressive 17-game streak of scoring at least 25 points, the longest in the NBA this season. The Heat were missing key figures, casting a shadow over a night where their managing general partner Micky Arison and Ruth Riley Hunter were highlighted as Hall of Fame candidates.
