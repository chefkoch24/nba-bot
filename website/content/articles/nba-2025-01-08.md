**Charlotte Hornets 115 - 104 Phoenix Suns**  
LaMelo Ball led the Charlotte Hornets to a 115-104 victory over the Phoenix Suns, snapping a 10-game losing streak by scoring 32 points and grabbing 10 rebounds. Miles Bridges contributed 21 points, while Nick Richards provided a strong performance off the bench with 15 points and 12 rebounds. Despite Devin Booker's 39 points and 10 assists, the Suns fell short, struggling in the second half without much support beyond Kevin Durant's 26 points. Charlotte outperformed Phoenix on the boards, with a dominant 59-42 rebounding advantage. The Hornets capitalized on a 37-17 second quarter to establish a 13-point halftime lead, fueled by Ball's impressive 29 points in the second half, including four 3-pointers. Notably, this game marked only the third time all season and first back-to-back occasion that Charlotte had all five starters on the floor together. Despite beginning strong, Phoenix faltered in their second game of a back-to-back, unable to generate scoring options outside of Booker and Durant. With the win, the Hornets secured just their second victory since Thanksgiving, and both teams are set to play again on Thursday with the Suns facing the Hawks and the Hornets visiting the Lakers.

**Washington Wizards 112 - 135 Houston Rockets**  
The Houston Rockets dominated the Washington Wizards 135-112, propelled by Jalen Green's explosive 22-point third-quarter performance en route to his 29 total points. Alperen Sengun contributed a double-double with 26 points and 10 rebounds, while Amen Thompson, showing remarkable growth in his second season, added another impressive double-double with 20 points and 15 boards. Fred VanVleet chipped in with 19 points as Houston extended its strong record on the road against Eastern Conference teams to 6-1. Despite holding the Rockets to a season-low 20 points in the first quarter, the Wizards couldn't maintain their momentum, suffering from 18 turnovers that converted into 35 points for Houston. Washington, already struggling with injuries to top players like Jordan Poole and Kyle Kuzma, faced their third consecutive loss. The Rockets' commanding 21-6 run in the third quarter, with Green's three three-pointers, sealed their victory. The Wizards are set to visit Philadelphia next, while Houston will face Memphis.

Meanwhile, Anthony Davis led the Lakers with 21 points and 12 rebounds, while LeBron James contributed 18 points, 10 rebounds, and eight assists.

**New Orleans Pelicans 97 - 104 Minnesota Timberwolves**  
Anthony Edwards led the Minnesota Timberwolves to a 104-97 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans, scoring 32 points and hitting seven 3-pointers to dampen Zion Williamson's return after a 27-game absence due to a hamstring strain. Williamson, in his seventh game of the season, contributed 22 points, six rebounds, and four assists. Minnesota controlled the game, with notable performances from Rudy Gobert, who had 14 rebounds and six blocks, and Naz Reid, who secured 13 points and 12 rebounds. Despite Dejounte Murray's 27-point effort for the Pelicans, the team struggled offensively, as CJ McCollum shot only 1 of 14. The Timberwolves capitalized with a decisive 19-2 run in the third quarter and never relinquished their lead, securing their win. Meanwhile, Donte DiVincenzo replaced Mike Conley at point guard, contributing to the Timberwolves' success. The Pelicans and Timberwolves now prepare for their upcoming matchups against Portland and Orlando, respectively.

**Utah Jazz 121 - 124 Atlanta Hawks**  
In a thrilling finish, Trae Young secured a 124-121 victory for the Atlanta Hawks over the Utah Jazz with a buzzer-beating 49-foot 3-pointer from beyond halfcourt. The dramatic shot came after Collin Sexton seemed to have forced overtime with his own clutch 3-pointer just seconds earlier. Young's performance was stellar, as he posted 24 points and 20 assists, helping Atlanta snap a three-game losing streak. Dyson Daniels contributed with 16 points, seven assists, and six rebounds, while Clint Capela and Deâ€™Andre Hunter added 18 and 17 points, respectively. Despite Lauri Markkanen's season-best effort of 35 points, including eight 3-pointers, the Jazz couldn't secure the win, with Utah only managing two victories in 15 home games. The Hawks concluded their road trip with this victory and will face Phoenix next, while the Jazz are set to host Miami.

**Denver Nuggets 106 - 118 Boston Celtics**  
The Boston Celtics bounced back from a loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder by defeating the Minnesota Timberwolves and Houston Rockets, marking a mixed but promising start to their four-game road trip. With a recent win-loss stretch of four victories out of six games, Boston remains competitive thanks to the dynamic contributions of stars Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, despite injuries. Tatum, who leads the team in points, rebounds, and assists, reassured fans about a recent minor injury scare, while teammate Kristaps Porzingis aims to regain full fitness following an ankle injury from Christmas Day. The Celtics' next challenge is against the Denver Nuggets, who have been averaging an impressive 124.5 points over their past 10 games. Led by MVP contender Nikola Jokic, Denver has coped without Aaron Gordon, sidelined by a calf strain, with Russell Westbrook filling in admirably, recording his record 201st career triple-double recently. The showdown promises competitiveness as the Celtics look to maintain their winning momentum against a high-scoring Nuggets squad.

**Golden State Warriors 98 - 114 Miami Heat**  
In a dramatic encounter, the Miami Heat and the Golden State Warriors are set to face off in San Francisco, each seeking redemption after recent defeats. The Heat suffered a significant 136-100 home loss to the Utah Jazz before putting forth a valiant effort in a double-overtime 123-118 loss to the Sacramento Kings, despite a grueling 58 minutes of play and the absence of star player Jimmy Butler due to a suspension. Butler's absence, however, is not new for the Warriors, who haven't faced him since November 2022. Meanwhile, the Warriors were recently embarrassed at home in a 129-99 defeat to the Kings, marking their second 30-point loss of the season. Without Jonathan Kuminga, who is out with a sprained ankle, the Warriors struggled to find rhythm with newcomers Dennis Schroder and Buddy Hield contributing just 10 points against Sacramento. Reflecting on their defensive resilience, Erik Spoelstra and the Heat aim to rely on defense during their six-game trip, while the Warriors look to rebound from their setbacks, bolstered by a determined locker room culture that has historically shown resilience after large defeats.
