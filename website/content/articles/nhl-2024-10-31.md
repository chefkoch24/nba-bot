**Columbus Blue Jackets 2 - 0 New York Islanders**  
Merzlikins makes 26 saves for Blue Jackets in shutout win against Islanders
 **COLUMBUS --** <forge-entity title="Elvis Merzlikins" slug="elvis-merzlikins-8478007" code="player">Elvis Merzlikins</forge-entity> made 26 saves for the Columbus Blue Jackets in a 2-0 win against the New York Islanders at Nationwide Arena on Wednesday. 
It was the second straight strong outing for Merzlikins; he came within 27 seconds of his 11th NHL shutout on Monday before the Edmonton Oilers scored a power-play goal in a 6-1 win.

“It feels really good to win the game right now,” he said. “We just have to keep working as hard as we are working now. Just take it game-by-game, step-by-step, and move forward.

“It’s obviously a nice feeling to get the shutout. It’s definitely not just me. It’s the team. They are helping me a lot. They’re really working hard for this. This is our shutout. It could be two in a row.” 
<forge-entity title="Damon Severson" slug="damon-severson-8476923" code="player">Damon Severson</forge-entity> and <forge-entity title="Justin Danforth" slug="justin-danforth-8479941" code="player">Justin Danforth</forge-entity> scored for the Blue Jackets (5-3-1), who are 3-0-1 in the past four games.

<forge-entity title="Semyon Varlamov" slug="semyon-varlamov-8473575" code="player">Semyon Varlamov</forge-entity> made 24 saves for the Islanders (3-5-2), who have lost four of five (1-4-0), including 3-1 to the Anaheim Ducks on Tuesday.

“We deserve to be disappointed because we played a really good game,” Islanders coach Patrick Roy said. “Back-to-back games like this, coming up with that kind of game. I thought we deserved better than that.

“I know how hard our guys are working. We're going to the net, bringing pucks to the net. The bounces just aren't going our way. There were great chances but we just couldn't finish. The guys know that.”

Severson gave the Blue Jackets a 1-0 lead at 5:43 of the third period when his wrist shot from a tight angle below the right circle deflected in off the skate of Islanders defenseman <forge-entity title="Ryan Pulock" slug="ryan-pulock-8477506" code="player">Ryan Pulock</forge-entity>.

“I just got lucky, hitting the D-man's skate,” Severson said. “We grinded our way through that one. We had chances, they had chances. It was kind of back and forth there. Both goalies played solid. It was nice to get that one late there.” 
Islanders forward <forge-entity title="Bo Horvat" slug="bo-horvat-8477500" code="player">Bo Horvat</forge-entity> said the game is one to learn from.

“You can call it puck luck all you want or unfortunate bounce, but at the end of the day, it’s the difference every night. It’s on us in here to get it done, including myself,” he said. “I’ve had so many opportunities to score and it hasn’t gone in. It’s up to me to fight through that and bury my opportunities.”

Danforth scored an empty-net goal at 17:57 for the 2-0 final.

“It's nice to have that heat at the end and the guys come through,” Blue Jackets coach Dean Evason said. “Elvis was terrific all night, made some key saves. We did a lot of right things at the end to hold a one- and two-goal lead.”

The Islanders were shut out for the fourth time this season.

“It’s definitely not our goaltending,” Horvat said. “It’s definitely not their fault. It’s on us. We’ve got to score goals at the end of the day.”

The game's notable additions included Olli Maatta making a successful debut for Utah and Clayton Keller capturing a goal during a power play, highlighting Utah's strong team cohesion and skillful execution.

Mercer scored on a shorthanded 2-on-1 at 1:35 of the second period, converting a rebound from Hischier’s shot off Silovs' right pad to make it 2-0.

**Los Angeles Kings 6 - 3 Vegas Golden Knights**  
In a notable NHL matchup, Anze Kopitar reached his milestone 800th career assist as the Los Angeles Kings secured a 6-3 victory over the Vegas Golden Knights at Crypto.com Arena. Kopitar, tallying a goal and two assists, became the sixth Europe-born player to achieve this feat with his assist for Kevin Fiala's power-play goal.

Meanwhile, Darcy Kuemper made 23 saves to help break the Knights' four-game winning streak. Despite Pavel Dorofeyev's two goals and Ilya Samsonov facing six goals on 26 shots, the Golden Knights couldn't maintain their momentum. Amidst the action, Tomas Hertl faced a high hit but returned to assist on Dorofeyev's second goal, while a mistake from Samsonov and a series of well-executed plays from the Kings defined the match’s outcome.
