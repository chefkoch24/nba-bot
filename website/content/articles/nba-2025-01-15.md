**Indiana Pacers 117 - 127 Cleveland Cavaliers**  
The Cleveland Cavaliers rebounded from their previous loss with a 127-117 victory over the Indiana Pacers, led by Donovan Mitchell's 35-point performance. Darius Garland added 24 points and Evan Mobley contributed a double-double with 22 points and 13 rebounds. Despite a strong showing from Pascal Siakam and Bennedict Mathurin, the Pacers' six-game winning streak was halted. The game turned in Cleveland's favor with a decisive 10-0 run in the third quarter, sparked by three-pointers from Max Strus, Georges Niang, and Mobley. Indiana struggled in the absence of All-Star point guard Tyrese Haliburton, and Mathurin's ejection late in the game sealed their fate. The Cavaliers dominated the boards with a 49-37 rebounding advantage, shutting down Siakam in the second half. Both teams finished with a 48% shooting accuracy, but the Cavaliers capitalized on their free-throw opportunities, hitting 26 of 31 attempts compared to the Pacers' 17 of 22. The Cavaliers will face off against Oklahoma City, while the Pacers travel to Detroit for their next matchups.

**Philadelphia 76ers 102 - 118 Oklahoma City Thunder**  
The Oklahoma City Thunder secured a commanding 118-102 victory over the injury-riddled Philadelphia 76ers, who were missing All-Stars Joel Embiid, Tyrese Maxey, and Paul George. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder with 32 points, while Jalen Williams added 24, as the team never trailed and maintained a 21-point lead in the game. The 76ers, struggling without their key players, saw Justin Edwards score 25 points and Jeff Dowtin Jr. contribute 18, but Philadelphia's recent form has them sliding towards the draft lottery, having lost three straight and six of their last eight games. With Embiid absent for most of the season, the 76ers have an 8-17 record without him, in contrast to their 7-6 performance with him. The Thunder, who shot an impressive 70% in the first quarter, are set to host the Cleveland Cavaliers next after their 15-game winning streak was snapped by Cleveland last week. Meanwhile, the 76ers will face the New York Knicks on Wednesday.

**Atlanta Hawks 122 - 117 Phoenix Suns**  
In a thrilling game, Trae Young led the Atlanta Hawks with a season-high 43 points, helping them overcome Devin Booker's impressive 35-point effort to beat the Phoenix Suns 122-117. This victory ended the Suns' three-game winning streak and extended their losing streak in Atlanta to 11 games, dating back to March 2014. Despite the absence of key forwards due to injuries, rookie Zaccharie Risacher was tasked with guarding Kevin Durant, who scored 31 points and grabbed nine rebounds for the Suns. The Hawks took a lead at halftime, buoyed by Young and Garrison Mathews' 3-point shooting, and after a brief Suns rally, maintained their lead in the fourth quarter. Notably, Onyeka Okongwu achieved a career-high with 21 rebounds, complementing his 22-point performance. Phoenix continues its road swing at Washington next, while the Hawks head to Chicago.

**Chicago Bulls 113 - 119 New Orleans Pelicans**  
The New Orleans Pelicans secured a 119-113 victory over the Chicago Bulls, with Trey Murphy III scoring a remarkable 32 points and Zion Williamson contributing 21 points, seven rebounds, and nine assists in his third game back from a left hamstring strain and a suspension. Despite struggling early with a shooting accuracy of 36.5% and going just 4 for 24 from beyond the arc in the first half, the Pelicans improved their performance significantly in the second half, making 10 of 25 three-pointers and shooting 52.3% overall. Chicago's Zach LaVine, who was limited to two points in the first half, ended with 25 points, while Nikola Vucevic and Coby White both scored 22 points. LaVine's streak of six consecutive 30-point games came to an end. The game remained tight until the Pelicans' decisive 10-2 run in the fourth quarter gave them the edge, with Jose Alvarado hitting crucial three-pointers to solidify their lead. New Orleans outscored the Bulls 33-27 in the final period, gaining their fourth win in the last seven games and moving to a 9-32 record.

**Milwaukee Bucks 130 - 115 Sacramento Kings**  
The Milwaukee Bucks ended the Sacramento Kings' seven-game winning streak with a 130-115 victory, highlighted by Giannis Antetokounmpo's 50th career triple-double with 30 points, 13 assists, and 11 rebounds. This achievement was Antetokounmpoâ€™s fifth triple-double of the season, not counting another in the NBA Cup final against Oklahoma City, which did not count towards official statistics. Contributing to the Bucks' commanding performance, Damian Lillard added 24 points, Brook Lopez 21, and A.J. Green 16, as the team never trailed and led by as many as 28 points. Sacramento's DeMar DeRozan scored 28, with De'Aaron Fox and Keon Ellis contributing 20 and 18 points, respectively. In a standout defensive moment, Lillard's rare block set the tone for the first half, helping lead a 21-2 first-quarter burst. Despite missing key players like Khris Middleton and Gary Trent Jr., the Bucks recorded their highest scoring game of the season, while the Kings, playing without Malik Monk and adjusting under interim head coach Doug Christie, fell to a 7-2 record during his tenure. The Kings will next face the Houston Rockets, and the Bucks will host the Orlando Magic.

**Dallas Mavericks 99 - 118 Denver Nuggets**  
Jamal Murray delivered an outstanding performance by scoring 45 points, 32 of which came in the first half, leading the Denver Nuggets to a commanding 118-99 victory over the Dallas Mavericks. This impressive display saw Murray easily surpass his previous season-high of 34 points. He shot 18-for-26, including 5-for-9 from beyond the arc, and added six assists and two steals. Although he fell five points short of his career high, Murray's 32 first-half points rank as the third-highest in the NBA this season. In the win, Michael Porter Jr. added 13 points and Nikola Jokic contributed a double-double with 10 points and 14 rebounds. The Nuggets secured their fourth consecutive win, and all recent victories have been by margins of 10 or more points. For Dallas, Kyrie Irving struggled in his return from a lumbar back sprain, scoring just 11 points on 4-for-18 shooting, while Dereck Lively II exited early due to a right ankle sprain. The Mavericks endured their second-worst loss of the season. Both teams have games lined up for Wednesday, with Denver hosting the Houston Rockets and Dallas visiting the New Orleans Pelicans.

**Portland Trail Blazers 114 - 132 Brooklyn Nets**  
The Brooklyn Nets managed to break their five-game losing streak with a narrow 112-111 win against the Utah Jazz, marked by a late-game layup from Utah's Isaiah Collier that secured the Jazz a win in overtime. Despite setbacks, including key players like Cam Thomas, Cameron Johnson, and D'Angelo Russell being sidelined due to injuries, Brooklyn saw standout performances from Tosan Evbuomwan, who scored a career-high 22 points, and Ben Simmons, who contributed 14 points, nine assists, and six rebounds, showing improved leadership and efficiency. However, Simmons expressed frustration over the team's focus on improving lottery odds instead of racking up wins, especially given their current rebuild situation. Meanwhile, the Portland Trail Blazers, dealing with their own injury issues, endured a two-game losing streak, most recently falling to the Miami Heat after a weak fourth quarter. Coach Chauncey Billups is hopeful for the return of players like Deandre Ayton and Jerami Grant, but their lineup remains uncertain due to the continued absences of injured players.
