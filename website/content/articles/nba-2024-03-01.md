**Orlando Magic 115 - 107 Utah Jazz**  
The Orlando Magic defeated the Utah Jazz 115-107 with Jalen Suggs and Paolo Banchero leading the way, combining for 44 points. Suggs hit three crucial 3-pointers in the final minutes, while Banchero, back from illness, scored 29 points and grabbed nine rebounds. The Magic won for the 10th time in 13 games, while the Jazz suffered their seventh loss in eight games.
