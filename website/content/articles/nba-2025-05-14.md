**Oklahoma City Thunder 112 - 105 Denver Nuggets**  
In a thrilling comeback, the Oklahoma City Thunder outplayed the Denver Nuggets in Game 5 of their Western Conference series, capitalizing on the dominant performances they've exhibited all season. Despite their decisive regular season, the Thunder are finding the post-season more challenging against a Nuggets team led by Nikola Jokic. Strikingly, Jokic has been struggling, hitting only 33.3% from the field during the last three games, a significant drop from his usual standards. Oklahoma City's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, another MVP finalist, has been impactful, averaging 27.5 points and effectively getting to the free-throw line. The Thunder's depth has been crucial, with 10 players contributing substantial minutes each game, contrasting with Denver's reliance on a tighter seven-man rotation. Coach Mark Daigneault praises his team's adaptation, emphasizing their growth and confidence-building throughout the series, which is crucial as the two teams head into the concluding games of this intense matchup.
