**Philadelphia 76ers 107 - 121 Indiana Pacers**  
In a game marked by Joel Embiid's early exit due to a sinus fracture, the Indiana Pacers secured a 121-107 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers. Tyrese Haliburton stood out for the Pacers with a stellar performance, scoring 32 points and dishing out 11 assists, including seven three-pointers that helped establish an early lead. Despite Embiid's absence after the first half, where he contributed 12 points, four rebounds, and five assists in just his sixth game of the season, the 76ers struggled to compensate. Tyrese Maxey led Philadelphia with 22 points, but it wasn't enough to counteract Indiana's dynamic play, featuring contributions from Pascal Siakam and Obi Toppin, who scored 23 and 20 points respectively, each grabbing eight rebounds. The Pacers' win highlighted their potential in the Eastern Conference despite previous struggles, while the 76ers continue to face challenges in maintaining a healthy lineup.

**Minnesota Timberwolves 97 - 87 Los Angeles Lakers**  
The Minnesota Timberwolves secured a 97-87 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers, marking their fifth win in six games. Anthony Edwards led the Timberwolves with 23 points, while Julius Randle contributed 21 points, and Rudy Gobert grabbed 13 rebounds. Minnesota extended their impressive home record against the Lakers, now 14-2 since the 2015-16 season, with this win being their fourth consecutive at home. Despite Anthony Davis's 23 points and 11 rebounds, the Lakers struggled, suffering their eighth loss in 11 games, partly due to 21 turnovers and LeBron James's absence due to foot soreness and personal reasons. The Timberwolves' defense again played a pivotal role, limiting the Lakers to 38.4% shooting. Austin Reaves returned for Los Angeles, scoring 18 points after a five-game absence, but it wasn't enough as the team continued to struggle offensively, averaging only 103.3 points in their recent games.

Despite a solid effort from Dorian Finney-Smith, who scored 19 points for Brooklyn, the Nets suffered their fifth loss in six games. The Grizzlies played at their preferred pace, surpassing their league-leading average with strong fast-break plays. Although the Nets launched an 11-0 run in the third quarter, the Grizzlies quickly regained control with an 18-3 response. The fast-paced game saw Memphis reach 107 points by the fourth quarter, already surpassing the highest score the Nets had previously allowed in their meetings this season.

**Chicago Bulls 109 - 95 Charlotte Hornets**  
The Chicago Bulls secured a 109-95 victory over the Charlotte Hornets, largely thanks to a balanced offensive effort led by Ayo Dosunmu's 19 points and Coby White's 18. Josh Giddey also contributed significantly with 17 points, nine rebounds, and seven assists, hitting three 3-pointers alongside Dosunmu. The Bulls maintained control throughout, holding back multiple Hornets' attempts to close the gap, while the Hornets suffered yet another defeat, marking their 13th loss in 16 games. Key moments included Lonzo Ball's hustled play resulting in a Zach LaVine alley-oop dunk that thrilled the crowd late in the first half. Former Bull Taj Gibson received a warm ovation when he entered the game near its end. Despite the Hornets slowly recovering from injuries, the absence of LaMelo Ball continues to be felt, as he missed a seventh straight game. On defense, Jalen Smith shone for the Bulls with a career-tying five blocks, matching his 11 points and 11 rebounds for a notable double-double. The Bulls now look forward to their next game in Toronto, whereas the Hornets prepare to host Philadelphia.

**Denver Nuggets 120 - 98 LA Clippers**  
The Denver Nuggets showcased their depth in a 120-98 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers, despite a quieter performance from star player Nikola Jokic, who tallied just 16 points, two assists, and seven rebounds. Jamal Murray led the Nuggets with a game-high 20 points, while Michael Porter Jr. added 17 points, including a crucial 10-point burst during a dominant 23-5 third-quarter run that shifted the momentum in Denver's favor. Meanwhile, the Clippers' James Harden struggled with nine turnovers, and Norman Powell, who had previously excelled against the Nuggets, was limited to 16 points. Denver's defense held the Clippers below 100 points for the first time since April 9, and the victory marked a break from their trend of losing after extended rest. The Nuggets' strategic resting of Jokic, who played under 30 minutes and wasn't needed in the fourth quarter, reflects Coach Michael Malone's effort to manage the star's workload. Both teams are set to play again on Monday, with the Clippers facing the Utah Jazz and the Nuggets traveling to take on the Sacramento Kings.

**Utah Jazz 126 - 134 Phoenix Suns**  
In a thrilling game marked by Kevin Durant's return to the lineup, the Phoenix Suns defeated the Utah Jazz 134-126, breaking a three-game losing streak. Durant, who returned after missing three games due to a left ankle sprain, teamed up with Devin Booker to score 30 and 34 points, respectively, both also contributing eight assists. Suns center Jusuf Nurkic rejoined after a five-game absence, while Utah's Jordan Clarkson returned from a seven-game hiatus and led the Jazz with 23 points. The second half saw the Suns surge ahead with six consecutive baskets, three by Booker, though the Jazz responded with a 15-4 run to close the gap. Nonetheless, Phoenix maintained their lead, bolstered by their 12-0 scoring run, and never lagged again. The Jazz's impressive 22 three-pointers and 56% shooting from beyond the arc weren't enough to clinch a win. Overall, the game was notable for its high-scoring pace and long-range shooting, with both teams collectively making 44 three-pointers. The Suns will next face Portland, while the Jazz play against the Los Angeles Clippers.

Meanwhile, the Portland Trail Blazers are on a four-game skid, struggling defensively, with key players like Robert Williams III and Donovan Clingan marked as questionable due to injuries.
