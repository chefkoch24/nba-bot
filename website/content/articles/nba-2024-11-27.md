**Miami Heat 103 - 106 Milwaukee Bucks**  
The Milwaukee Bucks secured their fifth consecutive victory by defeating the Miami Heat 106-103 in an NBA Cup game, with Damian Lillard shining by scoring 37 points and providing 12 assists. Despite relinquishing a 22-point lead, the Bucks managed to hold off Miami, largely due to Lillard's impressive performance, which tied him with Allen Iverson for ninth place in NBA history for games with at least 35 points and 10 assists. Notably, Lillard's 37 points were the second-highest by a Bucks player against Miami in regular-season history. The Bucks played without Giannis Antetokounmpo, who was sidelined due to knee swelling. Meanwhile, Miami struggled from beyond the arc, being outscored 60-30 in 3-point range. Nevertheless, Jimmy Butler's 23-point effort kept Miami competitive, as they repeatedly closed the gap but never managed to take the lead. AJ Green's crucial back-to-back 3-pointers in the final minutes helped secure the win for Milwaukee, who has improved to a .500 record at 9-9 and now leads East Group B in the Cup standings.

**Phoenix Suns 127 - 100 Los Angeles Lakers**  
The Phoenix Suns are set to welcome back Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal from injuries in their NBA Cup matchup against the Los Angeles Lakers, aiming to end a five-game losing streak. Durant and Beal's absence has notably impacted the Suns, with the team holding a 1-6 record without them. Durant, before his injury, was averaging 27.6 points and 6.6 rebounds, while Beal contributed 17.8 points per game. This game marks their first return since a loss to the New York Knicks, and their comeback is expected to boost the team's offense significantly. The Lakers, also coming off a tough loss against the Denver Nuggets, are led by Anthony Davis and LeBron James, but have struggled with consistency; Davis, in particular, had an uncharacteristically low performance against Denver. The Lakers and Suns have split their two previous matchups this season, with both teams hoping to gain an edge in West Group B of the NBA Cup, where the Lakers currently lead with a 2-0 record.
