**Cleveland Cavaliers 121 - 100 Miami Heat**  
In the opening game of the Eastern Conference first-round series, the Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Miami Heat 121-100, with Donovan Mitchell demonstrating his readiness for the playoffs by scoring 30 points and matching his playoff career high of four steals. This victory marked the seventh consecutive series where Mitchell scored at least 30 points in Game 1, tying a record held by Michael Jordan. Ty Jerome, playing in his first playoff game, delivered an impressive fourth-quarter performance with 16 of his 28 points, including key contributions that cemented Cleveland's lead. The Cavaliers, shooting 18 of 43 from beyond the arc, also saw strong performances from Darius Garland with 27 points. Despite Miami's efforts, cutting a 16-point deficit to single digits in the fourth quarter, Cleveland's timely 13-4 run, led by Jerome, put the game out of reach. Miami, the first No. 10 seed to advance to the playoffs from the Play-In Tournament, struggled with Cleveland's physical play, as noted by Tyler Herro, who contributed 21 points alongside Bam Adebayo's 24. This was the Cavaliers' highest playoff point total since a 2018 game against Toronto.

**Boston Celtics 103 - 86 Orlando Magic**  
In Game 1 of their playoff series against the Orlando Magic, the Boston Celtics secured a 103-86 victory despite a scare involving their star player, Jayson Tatum. Tatum, who scored 17 points, fell hard after a dunk attempt and injured his wrist, prompting concerns that eventually subsided as postgame X-rays came back clean. Derrick White led the Celtics with 30 points, while Payton Pritchard contributed 19 points off the bench. Despite Orlando's Paolo Banchero posting an impressive 36 points and 11 rebounds, the Magic were unable to maintain their halftime lead, partly due to their 15 turnovers leading to 24 Celtics points. Boston capitalized in the third quarter, outscoring Orlando 30-18, and ultimately stretched their lead to 19 points in the final quarter. Jaylen Brown, returning after missing games due to a knee issue, tallied 16 points and added excitement with a celebratory dunk. The game marked a solid start for the defending champions as they aim to repeat last season's success, with Game 2 scheduled at home.

In a commanding display, the Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Memphis Grizzlies 131-80 in Game 1 of their Western Conference playoff series, marking the fifth-largest margin of victory in NBA postseason history. The 51-point win was the largest for a Game 1 in playoff history, just seven points shy of the all-time record. Key contributions came from Aaron Wiggins with 21 points, Jalen Williams with 20, and Chet Holmgren who posted a double-double with 19 points and 10 rebounds. Despite a modest 15-point performance by scoring champion Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the Thunder shot 50.5% from the field, capitalizing on a 20-0 second-quarter run to seize a 55-22 advantage. Meanwhile, the Grizzlies struggled, shooting only 34.4% overall, with Ja Morant contributing 17 points and Jaren Jackson Jr. managing just four points. This marked Memphis' first playoff game under interim coach Tuomas Iisalo, who remains optimistic about the series' continuation.

**Houston Rockets 85 - 95 Golden State Warriors**  
In Game 1 of the first-round playoff series, Stephen Curry led the Golden State Warriors to a 95-85 victory over the Houston Rockets with a standout performance, scoring 31 points, including hitting five 3-pointers. The Warriors, who entered the playoffs as the seventh seed, built a 23-point lead in the third quarter, but the second-seeded Rockets closed the gap to four points late in the game. Key contributions included a crucial 3-pointer by Moses Moody that initiated a decisive 7-0 run, securing the win for the Warriors. Jimmy Butler debuted in the playoffs for Golden State with 25 points, while Houston's Alperen Sengun impressed with 26 points in his first playoff game. However, the Rockets struggled with shooting, making only 6 of 29 3-pointers and 11 of 20 free throws. This victory marked Steve Kerr's 100th career playoff win, tying him with Larry Brown for the sixth-most playoff coaching victories. This win continues the Warriors' dominance over the Rockets in recent playoff history, eliminating them multiple times from 2015 to 2019.
