**Denver Broncos 41 - 32 Cleveland Browns**  
The Denver Broncos defeated the Cleveland Browns 41-32, overshadowing career-high performances from Browns quarterback Jameis Winston and wide receiver Jerry Jeudy. Jaâ€™Quan McMillian's late-game pick-six sealed the win for Denver, as dual pick-sixes by Nik Bonitto and McMillian thwarted Winston's franchise-record 497 passing yards and four touchdowns. Jeudy, facing his former team, set an NFL record with 235 receiving yards against a previous team. Although Cleveland led late in the game after a Winston touchdown pass, a go-ahead field goal by Wil Lutz for Denver, followed by McMillian's interception return for a touchdown, ensured the Broncos' victory. Despite Winston and Jeudy's impressive stats, the Browns fell short, dropping to 3-9 for the season. Meanwhile, the Broncos improved to 8-5 and entered their bye week holding the seventh playoff spot, enhancing their postseason prospects.
