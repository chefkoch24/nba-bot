**Indiana Pacers 129 - 113 Chicago Bulls**  
The Indiana Pacers secured a dominating 129-113 victory over the Chicago Bulls in Indianapolis, with Pascal Siakam leading the way with 26 points and Thomas Bryant contributing a season-high 22 points and eight rebounds. Despite the absence of center Myles Turner due to illness, the Pacers extended their winning streak to four, marking their 10th win in 13 games, solidifying their position in the Eastern Conference standings. Two-time All-Star Tyrese Haliburton showcased his playmaking skills with 16 points and 13 assists, continuing his impressive run with 51 assists to just five turnovers over the last six games. The Pacers built an early lead, taking advantage of 14 first-half turnovers by the Bulls, which allowed them to maintain a comfortable margin throughout the game. Zach LaVine's 31 points led Chicago, but they struggled to keep pace with Indiana’s tempo, trailing by as much as 34 points in the third quarter and never closing the gap to single digits. The Bulls, who were hoping to continue their resurgence in the playoff race, now trail 0-2 in the season series against the Pacers and will look to bounce back during their upcoming five-game homestand.

The Knicks, who had won nine straight before their recent skid, got a balanced contribution from all starters, with each scoring in double digits. Despite a strong start and a halftime lead of 55-51, the Raptors faltered as they endured a 15-0 Knicks run in the fourth quarter, missing eight shots and giving away two turnovers.

In a game marked by the absence of key players, Tyrese Maxey led the Philadelphia 76ers to a 109-103 victory over the Washington Wizards by scoring a crucial basket with 23.7 seconds remaining, capping off his 29-point performance. Despite the absence of stars like Joel Embiid and Paul George for the Sixers, and Jordan Poole and Malcolm Brogdon for the Wizards, the game had significant fourth-quarter drama. Guerschon Yabusele contributed 21 points and made a pivotal block to secure the win for Philadelphia. The Wizards mounted a comeback, erasing a 16-point deficit to briefly lead, driven by Bilal Coulibaly. However, Maxey's clutch free throws and go-ahead basket reclaimed the lead for Philadelphia. The Wizards, who have the worst NBA record at 6-29, saw Jared Butler score 26 points, while Corey Kispert added 23. In an audience that included "Party of Five" actor Scott Wolf, the Sixers secured their win amidst low ticket prices, with secondary market tickets below $10 just before the tipoff.

The Detroit Pistons continued their strong run by securing a 113-98 victory over the Brooklyn Nets, marking their fifth consecutive win and pushing them above .500 with a 19-18 record. Malik Beasley led the game with 23 points, while Cade Cunningham, despite having an off night, still contributed alongside reserves Simone Fontecchio and Marcus Sasser, who combined for 32 points. The Pistons' bench outshone Brooklyn's, outscoring them 50-20, and their quick transition game helped them dominate the fast break points 38-13. Detroit's impressive field goal percentage of 52.3% and domination in the paint by 54-36 highlighted their efficiency. Meanwhile, Brooklyn struggled, missing key players and shooting only 38.4% from the field. Noah Clowney's 29 points were not enough to prevent the Nets from extending their losing streak at Barclays Center to seven games.
