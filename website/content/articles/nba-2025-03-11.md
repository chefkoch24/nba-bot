Dyson Daniels led the Atlanta Hawks with 25 points, guiding them to a 132-123 victory over the injury-laden Philadelphia 76ers. Despite missing key players like Trae Young, the Hawks showcased depth as six players scored double figures, including Zaccharie Risacher's impressive 22 points, with 20 coming in the first half alone.

Quentin Grimes shone for the 76ers with a game-high 35 points, 17 in the final quarter, while Ricky Council IV equaled his career-high with 19 points.

**Boston Celtics 114 - 108 Utah Jazz**  
The Boston Celtics, led by Sam Hauser's career-high 33 points and nine 3-pointers, held off the Utah Jazz 114-108 despite missing key players like Jayson Tatum and Kristaps Porzingis.

**Brooklyn Nets 111 - 108 Los Angeles Lakers**  
The Brooklyn Nets ended their seven-game losing streak with a narrow 111-108 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers, who played their first game without LeBron James due to a strained left groin. Noah Clowney led the Nets with 19 points, and both Cam Johnson and Keon Johnson added 18 points each. Despite securing a triple-double with 22 points, 12 rebounds, and 12 assists, Luka Doncic struggled with shooting, hitting only 8 of 26 attempts for the Lakers. Austin Reaves also had a tough night, shooting 3 for 14, as the Lakers faltered with several key players absent. Gabe Vincent led the Lakers with 24 points while Reaves contributed 17 points, 10 assists, and eight rebounds. In a thrilling finish, Luca Doncic managed a 35-foot shot, trimming the deficit to two points, but a strategic play by the Nets allowed Clowney to score a crucial dunk while being fouled, securing the win. This marks Doncic's fifth triple-double of the season, and the Nets successfully held their ground after previously failing to maintain their lead against Charlotte. The Nets now look forward to facing the NBA-leading Cleveland Cavaliers, while the Lakers will regroup before visiting Milwaukee on Thursday.

Miles Bridges led the Hornets with 35 points, while Mark Williams contributed a double-double with 24 points and 10 rebounds.

**Chicago Bulls 121 - 103 Indiana Pacers**  
The Chicago Bulls extended their winning streak to three games with a commanding 121-103 victory over the Indiana Pacers, led by Josh Giddey, who scored a season-high 29 points and grabbed 10 rebounds before exiting the game with a right ankle injury. Coby White matched Giddey's 29 points, further solidifying the Bulls' position in the final play-in spot in the Eastern Conference. The Pacers, missing point guard Tyrese Haliburton due to a hip issue, struggled with shooting, hitting only 39.6% from the field and managing just 10 of 40 from beyond the arc. Myles Turner led the Pacers with 15 points, but with their starters' minutes limited by coach Rick Carlisle, the team couldn't recover from a second-quarter 40-point surge by the Bulls. Nikola Vucevic's 11 points and 11 rebounds marked his 195th career double-double, surpassing Horace Grant for the third most in Bulls history. The win helped Chicago avoid a season series sweep by Indiana, who had previously won three games by an average margin of over 13 points.

In a thrilling showdown, the Memphis Grizzlies overcame an early 16-point deficit to edge out the Phoenix Suns 120-118, with Ja Morant leading with 29 points and 12 assists. Rookie Cam Spencer, on a two-way contract, contributed a career-high 16 points for Memphis, including decisive free throws in the final seconds that secured their third consecutive victory.

The game was marked by a tense exchange between Durant and Spencer, resulting in technical fouls for both after a confrontation late in the third quarter. Despite shooting 52.6% from beyond the arc, the Suns fell short and remain in the hunt for a play-in tournament spot, battling a depleted roster without Bradley Beal. Meanwhile, Memphis navigated their seventh close game out of the last ten without leading scorer Jaren Jackson Jr. Both teams are set to return to action on Wednesday, with the Suns facing Houston and the Grizzlies hosting Utah.

Jamal Murray contributed significantly with 34 points. Despite the Thunder's initial strong showing and halftime lead driven by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Isaiah Hartenstein, Oklahoma City's momentum waned after All-Star Jalen Williams exited with a hip strain. The defeat halted the Thunder's seven-game winning streak, raising concerns over Williams' quick recovery as they seek to maintain their top Western Conference standing. Denver capitalized on their third-quarter lead, with key contributions from Russell Westbrook and Peyton Watson, securing the game in the fourth quarter.

**Sacramento Kings 104 - 133 New York Knicks**  
In a game riddled with setbacks and high stakes, the New York Knicks managed to stave off their losing streak against the Sacramento Kings despite lacking their All-Star guard Jalen Brunson due to a sprained ankle. Entering the contest with the weight of three consecutive losses and two defeats on a five-game Western swing, the Knicks were propelled by strong performances from Karl-Anthony Towns, who posted 23 points and 10 rebounds, and Mikal Bridges, who added 22 points. The clash highlighted New York's resilience as they aimed to complete a season sweep against Sacramento after a previous 143-120 triumph, even as Sacramento grappled with the continued absences of key players Malik Monk and Domantas Sabonis. The Kings, dealing with the aftermath of a narrow 111-110 overtime loss to the Clippers, showcased efforts from DeMar DeRozan and Zach LaVine, but still found themselves 1 1/2 games behind the Clippers in the standings. Despite out-rebounding their opponents and limiting turnovers, Sacramento's inability to close out games cost them as they struggled to hold onto their place in the competitive Western Conference standings.
