“It’s one of the toughest years I’ve been a part of, coming in with so much expectation and just not living up to it,” Nashville forward <forge-entity title="Ryan O&#39;Reilly" slug="ryan-o-reilly-8475158" code="player">Ryan O&#39;Reilly</forge-entity> said. “It hasn’t been fun, but we still have a lot of hockey left. We have to try to build something here, and we’re not going to quit. It’s going to be on us leaders. We have to step up and find a way to generate something.” 
<forge-entity title="Ondrej Palat" slug="ondrej-palat-8476292" code="player">Ondrej Palat</forge-entity> gave the Devils a 1-0 lead at 13:45 of the first period with a one-timer from between the circles off a cross-slot pass from Luke Hughes.

“The effort I really liked, for sure,” Devils coach Sheldon Keefe said. “I don’t know that our whole overall game was quite as crisp and smooth quite honestly, but Nashville did a good job and probably won a little more of the territorial battle that we won last night. With that said, the effort was good. Obviously, we just kept adding to our lead throughout. Little things were great tonight. The penalty kill was perfect, power play gets the goal, \[Daws\] was incredible. All those things add up and you get on the right side of it.”

Hamilton made it 2-0 at 9:14 of the second period with a one-timer from a tight angle in the bottom of the right circle off a pass from Hischier.

“I think they probably outplayed us, and we were the team that scored the goals,” Hamilton said. “Especially in the start, and then we kind of took it over when we started scoring more. But \[Daws\] was unreal. We gave up some chances, some looks, and they were playing hard. We just capitalized on some chances.”

“We know as a group we’re going to get our looks, get our opportunities as we did tonight,” Predators coach Andrew Brunette said. “We just can’t give it the other way too much, especially with where we’re at on the back end. We’ve got to protect our defensemen, protect our goalie. We didn’t do that enough tonight.”
