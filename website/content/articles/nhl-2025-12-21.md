**Florida Panthers 2 - 6 St Louis Blues**  
In a thrilling overtime win, Aleksander Barkov scored with just 17 seconds remaining to give the Florida Panthers a 2-1 victory over the St. Louis Blues, marking their third consecutive win. Barkov's impressive wrist shot came after he forced a turnover and drew a tripping penalty on Brayden Schenn. Despite having been on the ice for over two minutes, Barkov delivered when it mattered most, reflecting his return from a recent illness that sidelined him for two games. Uvis Balinskis scored his first goal of the season to tie the game in the second period, while Sergei Bobrovsky made 26 saves for the Panthers. Oskar Sundqvist scored the lone goal for the Blues, who are now on a three-game losing streak. The Panthers' coach, Paul Maurice, praised Barkov's performance as a testament to his status as a special player, while St. Louis acknowledged the difficulty of facing a team that has dominated the league in recent years.
