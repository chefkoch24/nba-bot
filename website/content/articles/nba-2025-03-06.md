**Boston Celtics 128 - 118 Portland Trail Blazers**  
In a thrilling matchup, Payton Pritchard and Derrick White combined for an impressive 84 points, guiding the Boston Celtics to a 128-118 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers. Pritchard scored a career-high 43 points, sinking a personal best of 10 three-pointers, while White also achieved career highs with 41 points and nine threes. This performance marked the first time in Celtics history that two players scored over 40 points each in the same game, and they became the first NBA duo to achieve nine or more three-pointers in a game. The Celtics were missing key players Jayson Tatum, Jrue Holiday, and Kristaps Porzingis but managed 23 three-pointers to overpower the Blazers, who were forced into jump shots due to Boston's effective defensive adjustments. Despite Portland's late rally, the Celtics secured victory with vital defensive stops and free throws. Anfernee Simons led the Blazers with 30 points, with Shaedon Sharpe adding 25, as they neared the end of their challenging road trip. This win underscores Boston's depth and bolsters their aspirations for another NBA championship run.

Meanwhile, Cleveland's Evan Mobley and De'Andre Hunter each contributed 16 points.

**Memphis Grizzlies 103 - 120 Oklahoma City Thunder**  
The Oklahoma City Thunder, led by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, continue to dominate the NBA's Western Conference, adding a 41-point effort from Gilgeous-Alexander to their resume in their victory over the Memphis Grizzlies. This win follows a recent streak of high-scoring games by Gilgeous-Alexander, including a 51-point outing earlier in the week against the Houston Rockets, making it his fourth 50-point game in the past six weeks. Despite their efforts, the Memphis Grizzlies have been struggling, now having lost three consecutive games in the final seconds. Their situation is exacerbated by injuries to key players, including All-Star forward Jaren Jackson Jr., who is sidelined with a Grade 2 ankle sprain, and Ja Morant, who is dealing with shoulder soreness. The Grizzlies' coach, Taylor Jenkins, emphasized the team's need to improve their defensive performance, as they have allowed crucial late-game points to their opponents, but he remains confident in the team's resilience to bounce back from their current slump.

Nikola Jokic contributed with 22 points and 14 rebounds, while Russell Westbrook added 25 points, playing a pivotal role by scoring seven consecutive points to ignite the Nuggets' comeback. Jamal Murray also shone with 24 points, notably converting nine free throws after being fouled on multiple 3-point attempts. Despite DeMar DeRozan's impressive 35-point performance, including 18 in the third quarter, and Zach LaVine's fourth-quarter surge with two deep 3-pointers, the Kings fell short. Jake LaRivia provided an early boost for Sacramento, scoring 15 points in the first half, though he struggled in the latter stages. The Nuggets excelled in the non-Jokic minutes, outscoring the Kings 12-2 to start the final quarter with Jokic on the bench.

**Milwaukee Bucks 137 - 107 Dallas Mavericks**  
In a standout performance, Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 32 points to surpass the 20,000 career point milestone, becoming the 52nd player in NBA history to achieve this feat. The Milwaukee Bucks, bolstered by Damian Lillard's 34-point effort and Kevin Porter Jr.'s triple-double, secured a dominant 137-107 victory over the undermanned Dallas Mavericks. The game marked Milwaukee's eighth win in nine games, despite the absence of Bobby Portis, who is serving a 25-game suspension. Antetokounmpo, playing less than 25 minutes and adding 15 rebounds, joined elite company by reaching 20,000 points at a younger age than all but five players, including basketball legends like LeBron James and Michael Jordan. Dallas struggled with only eight available players, missing star Kyrie Irving due to an ACL injury, and couldn't keep pace with the Bucks' high-scoring onslaught. Klay Thompson led the Mavericks with 28 points. The Bucks were able to rest their stars in the fourth quarter and achieved their highest point total and most lopsided win of the season.
