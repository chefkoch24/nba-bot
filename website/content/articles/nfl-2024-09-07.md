**Chiefs 27 - 20 Ravens**  
The Kansas City Chiefs secured a dramatic 27-20 victory over the Baltimore Ravens in the NFL season opener after a last-second review overturned a Ravens' touchdown. With both teams bracing for overtime, referee Shawn Hochuli determined that Isaiah Likely’s foot was out of bounds, sealing the win for Kansas City. Patrick Mahomes threw for 291 yards and accounted for two touchdowns, while Lamar Jackson had an impressive performance with 273 passing yards, 122 rushing yards, and a touchdown. The game featured a star-studded crowd including pop star Taylor Swift and Olympian Quincy Hall, and saw the Chiefs capitalize on Baltimore’s miscues despite a strong effort by Jackson to rally his team.

**Philadelphia Eagles 34 - 29 Green Bay Packers**  
In a historic NFL debut in South America, Saquon Barkley led the Philadelphia Eagles to a 34-29 victory over the Green Bay Packers in Sao Paulo, scoring three touchdowns and rushing for 109 yards. This performance marked Barkley's first game with the Eagles, making him the first player since Terrell Owens in 2004 to score three touchdowns in his team debut. The game had a thrilling atmosphere likened to a playoff by Eagles coach Nick Sirianni, and despite concerns about the playing surface and international travel, the crowd's enthusiasm was infectious. The Packers faced a setback with quarterback Jordan Love's injury in the final minute after an impressive performance, which included a career-long 70-yard touchdown pass to Jayden Reed. The Eagles capitalized on key turnovers and maintained control with valuable contributions from Jalen Hurts and A.J. Brown, who also delivered a 67-yard touchdown reception.
