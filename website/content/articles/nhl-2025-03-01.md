**Dallas Stars 6 - 2 Los Angeles Kings**  
Roope Hintz achieved a career milestone by delivering four assists, powering the Dallas Stars to a 6-2 victory over the Los Angeles Kings. Logan Stankoven shone with two goals, and Jason Robertson contributed a goal and two assists, marking his fourth consecutive season with 25 or more goals, becoming only the sixth Dallas player to achieve this feat. The Stars, now 9-2-1 in their last 12 games, benefited from solid performances by Thomas Harley, who added two assists, and goalie Jake Oettinger, who made 29 saves. Despite goals from Warren Foegele and Trevor Moore, the Kings’ seven-game point streak ended, partly due to their penalty struggles exploited by Dallas's potent power play. Stankoven, praised for his perseverance, scored his second goal with a wraparound, while Sam Steel capped the scoring with a short-handed breakaway. This victory also marked Dallas's 16th win since January 1, the highest in the league during that period.
