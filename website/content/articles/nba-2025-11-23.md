**Charlotte Hornets 116 - 131 LA Clippers**  
In a high-scoring affair, James Harden exploded for 55 points, making 10 three-pointers and leading the Los Angeles Clippers to a 131-116 victory over the Charlotte Hornets. This performance marked Harden's highest scoring game of the season and the 11th-highest of his career. Ivica Zubac contributed significantly with 18 points, nine rebounds, and six assists. Despite a strong start by the Hornets, who nailed seven of their first eight shots, the Clippers managed to take control by building a 14-point first-half lead. Charlotte’s comeback was hindered by LaMelo Ball's foul trouble and Ryan Kalkbrenner's early exit due to an ankle injury. Rookie Kon Knueppel shone for the Hornets with 26 points, while Brandon Miller returned to action with 21 points after a shoulder injury. Meanwhile, Chris Paul, potentially in his final game in his home state of North Carolina, provided eight assists, highlighting his playmaking skills. Both teams face road games on Sunday, with the Clippers heading to Cleveland and the Hornets visiting Atlanta.

Rookie Cooper Flagg contributed 12 points and seven rebounds following his standout performance the night before. Both teams suffered key injuries, with Memphis losing Jock Landale to a neck injury and Dallas' P.J. Washington exiting with a potential back issue.

**Denver Nuggets 123 - 128 Sacramento Kings**  
The Sacramento Kings aimed to end an eight-game losing streak without their key player Domantas Sabonis due to injury, causing them to rely heavily on Zach LaVine and DeMar DeRozan. Despite impressive wins against top teams like Milwaukee and Golden State earlier in the season, the Kings struggled significantly, losing each game during this skid by double digits and facing frustration as their playoff aspirations dwindle with a 3-13 start. In their Saturday matchup against the Denver Nuggets, the Kings faced a challenge from Nikola Jokić, who scored 44 points. However, Denver faced their own setbacks with Aaron Gordon exiting with a hamstring injury and missing Christian Braun. Peyton Watson stepped up effectively in Braun's absence, posting impressive stats including a career-high 32 points earlier in the week, and making crucial defensive plays. Jamal Murray continued to be a strong contributor with 26 points and 10 assists against Houston, making Watson's improved play a crucial support to the team's efforts without Gordon and Braun.
