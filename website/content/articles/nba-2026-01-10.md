This victory sets the stage for a potential revenge encounter with the Sacramento Kings, who previously defeated the Warriors on November 5th. Notably, trade discussions surround Jonathan Kuminga, who has excelled against the Kings, amid Sacramento's ongoing six-game losing streak.

**Portland Trail Blazers 111 - 105 Houston Rockets**  
The Portland Trail Blazers secured their fifth consecutive victory in a dramatic 103-102 win over the Houston Rockets, highlighted by a controversial ending. Houston's Tari Eason appeared to win the game with a tip-in at the buzzer, but the basket was disallowed after replays showed the ball was still on his fingertips as the red light came on. Trail Blazers' Deni Avdija shone brightly, scoring 41 points, the second-highest of his career, contributing significantly to the win. Despite the Rockets' dominant rebounding, their poor shooting ultimately led to their downfall. Rockets coach Ime Udoka criticized the team's inconsistency over the quarters and their overall shooting percentages. Meanwhile, Kevin Durant is on the verge of a personal milestone, needing just 15 points to surpass Wilt Chamberlain on the all-time scoring list. Avdija's outstanding performance has put him in All-Star consideration, and he's driving Portland's recent success. As the Trail Blazers prepare to meet the Rockets again, they aim to maintain their winning momentum.

**Los Angeles Lakers 101 - 105 Milwaukee Bucks**  
The Milwaukee Bucks narrowly held off the Los Angeles Lakers, securing a victory in their meeting. The Bucks are striving for consistent wins, despite falling to the Golden State Warriors 120-113 on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the Lakers, grappling with key player absences, suffered a 107-91 defeat to the San Antonio Spurs, marking their second-lowest scoring game of the season. Luka Doncic notched a 38-point triple-double, and the team struggled without LeBron James, who was resting. Although the Lakers maintained a top-four Western Conference spot with a 23-12 record, they have faltered, losing five of their last nine games. Giannis Antetokounmpo led the Bucks with 34 points, yet their attempt to secure a three-game winning streak remains elusive, with Kevin Porter Jr. urging perseverance. In their Nov. 15 matchup, the Lakers had bested the Bucks 119-95, showcasing a standout performance from Doncic.
