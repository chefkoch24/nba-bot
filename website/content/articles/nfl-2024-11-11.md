**Kansas City Chiefs 16 - 14 Denver Broncos**  
In a dramatic finish, the Kansas City Chiefs preserved their unbeaten streak by blocking a potential game-winning field goal from the Denver Broncos, securing a 16-14 victory. As time expired, Chiefs linebacker Leo Chenal managed to deflect Wil Lutz's 35-yard attempt, thanks to a well-executed push by Kansas City's defensive line, which capitalized on a flaw they observed in the Broncos' field-goal setup. The victory extended the Chiefs' winning streak to an impressive 15 games, dating back to last season, and marked the team's best start to a season, matching the franchise record. Quarterback Patrick Mahomes contributed with 266 passing yards and a touchdown, while Travis Kelce added eight receptions for 64 yards and a score. Despite the Broncos leading 14-10 at halftime with effective defense and strategic scoring, Kansas City's resilience once again shone through as they fought back to maintain their perfect record. A notable appearance at the game was made by pop star Taylor Swift, who was there cheering for Kelce and the Chiefs.

**Washington Commanders 27 - 28 Pittsburgh Steelers**  
In a thrilling matchup, Russell Wilson's late-game heroics led the Pittsburgh Steelers to a narrow 28-27 victory over the Washington Commanders. Wilson, replacing Justin Fields, found Mike Williams with a crucial 32-yard touchdown pass in the final minutes, marking his third scoring throw of the game. Despite his first interception in 11 months, Wilson completed 14 of 28 passes for 195 yards, and his decisive playmaking proved vital in the comeback win. Meanwhile, Jayden Daniels of the Commanders, who was playing despite a rib injury, couldn't capitalize on his opportunities, completing 17 of 34 passes for 202 yards. Washington, aiming for a historic season milestone, faltered in maintaining their lead and faced setbacks like a controversial fourth-down spot that gave Pittsburgh the ball in the critical closing moments. The Commanders' bid for a clean fourth-down record ended with a missed conversion in a tense finish. Despite several mishaps, including a failed fake punt by the Steelers, Pittsburgh held on for their fourth consecutive victory. The game was marked by key plays, including George Pickens' acrobatic touchdown catch and decisive defensive stoppages for the Steelers amid injuries to significant players on both sides.

**Dallas Cowboys 6 - 34 Philadelphia Eagles**  
In a commanding performance, the Philadelphia Eagles, led by Jalen Hurts, secured a 34-6 victory over the struggling Dallas Cowboys, who played without star quarterback Dak Prescott. Hurts brilliantly rebounded from an early fumble, throwing two touchdown passes and rushing for two more scores. Despite a resilient effort by defender Micah Parsons, Dallas fell apart, with Cooper Rush struggling under pressure, resulting in two lost fumbles. The Eagles' defense dominated, forcing five turnovers, and the ineffectiveness of the Cowboys' offense, which managed only 146 total yards, raised questions about coach Mike McCarthy's future. This game marked Hurts' fourth consecutive game with a touchdown pass, a rushing TD, and a passer rating over 100, a feat no other quarterback in NFL history has achieved. The Eagles now sit atop the NFC East with a 7-2 record, while Dallas remains winless at home this season.

**Arizona Cardinals 31 - 6 New York Jets**  
In a dominant performance, Kyler Murray led the Arizona Cardinals to a decisive 31-6 victory over the New York Jets, marking their fourth consecutive win. Despite a hard hit from Jets linebacker Quincy Williams that sent his helmet flying, Murray remained unfazed, throwing for 266 yards, completing 22 of 24 passes, and running for two touchdowns. The Cardinals established a solid lead early, scoring on four of their first five drives, with touchdowns from James Conner, Trey McBride, Marvin Harrison Jr., and Michael Wilson. Murray also set a franchise record by completing 17 consecutive passes. The Cardinals' defense held strong, preventing the Jets from scoring a touchdown for the third straight home game. On the other side, the Jets struggled offensively despite Aaron Rodgers completing 22 of 35 passes for 151 yards, with the team only managing two field goals. Interim Jets coach Jeff Ulbrich took responsibility for the team's lack of preparedness as they fell to 1-4 under his leadership. The Cardinals now enter a bye week before facing the Seahawks, while the Jets return home to play the Colts.

**Jacksonville Jaguars 7 - 12 Minnesota Vikings**  
In a defensive battle, the Minnesota Vikings triumphed over the Jacksonville Jaguars with a narrow 12-7 victory, marked by Minnesota's suffocating defense that limited the Jaguars to just 143 yards—Jacksonville's lowest in coach Doug Pederson's last three seasons. The Vikings dominated possession, running 82 plays to the Jaguars' 43 and holding the ball for over 42 minutes. Despite Sam Darnold's struggles, throwing three interceptions while targeting Justin Jefferson, Minnesota's John Parker Romo kicked four field goals in his NFL debut, leading the scoring for the Vikings. Mac Jones, filling in for Jacksonville's injured Trevor Lawrence, struggled with turnovers, including a late interception that sealed the Vikings' win. The Vikings improved to 7-2 with this win, while the Jaguars fell to 2-8.

**New Orleans Saints 20 - 17 Atlanta Falcons**  
In Darren Rizzi's debut as interim head coach, the New Orleans Saints snapped a seven-game losing streak with a 20-17 victory over the Atlanta Falcons, the NFC South’s top team and their oldest rival. Marquez Valdes-Scantling, in only his second game for New Orleans, was instrumental with three catches for 109 yards and two touchdowns. The game was marked by key defensive plays, including Tyrann Mathieu's vital interception of Kirk Cousins late in the fourth quarter and Chase Young's decisive sack and strip that set the Falcons back significantly. Alvin Kamara not only contributed significantly with 109 yards from scrimmage but also became the franchise’s all-time leading rusher, surpassing Mark Ingram. Atlanta outgained New Orleans with 468 yards but missed several scoring chances, highlighted by Younghoe Koo’s first career game with three failed field-goal attempts. Despite their strong rushing game, led by Bijan Robinson with 116 yards and two touchdowns, the Falcons couldn't capitalize and lost a winnable game. The Saints' win was a much-needed morale boost for the team and its fans, as they eye their next matchup against Cleveland.

In a dramatic finish, the San Francisco 49ers edged out the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 23-20, thanks to Jake Moody's game-winning 44-yard field goal as time expired. Despite missing three earlier attempts, Moody kept his composure and redeemed himself, as the 49ers secured their consecutive win for the first time this season. The game marked Christian McCaffrey's debut, contributing 39 rushing yards and 68 receiving yards. Meanwhile, tensions flared on the 49ers' sideline as Deebo Samuel expressed frustration after Moody's third miss, but the team moved past it to secure the victory. Brock Purdy had an impressive game, passing for 353 yards and two touchdowns, including one to rookie Ricky Pearsall, who scored his first NFL touchdown after overcoming a significant off-field incident. Tampa Bay struggled to finish strong once again, with Baker Mayfield's efforts falling short as the Bucs suffered their fourth consecutive loss. The defeat came with injuries to key players like Tristan Wirfs, adding to the Bucs' woes as they head into their bye week.

In a game marked by Justin Herbert's dual-threat performance, the Los Angeles Chargers secured a 27-17 victory over the Tennessee Titans, marking their third consecutive win and the best start in six years at 6-3. Herbert threw for a touchdown and ran for another, while the Chargers' defense registered seven sacks, continuing their impressive record of allowing 20 or fewer points in each of their first nine games. Despite Tennessee's strong start, highlighted by Will Levis's 47-yard touchdown pass to Calvin Ridley, Herbert's effective leadership and a crucial call reversal before halftime swung momentum in favor of the Chargers. The Titans struggled offensively due to penalties and missed opportunities, such as Nick Folk's missed field goal, breaking his 20-kick streak. As each team prepares for their next matchups, the Chargers face Cincinnati, and the Titans will host Minnesota.

**Houston Texans 23 - 26 Detroit Lions**  
In an astonishing Sunday night game, the Detroit Lions overcame a turbulent performance by quarterback Jared Goff, who threw a career-high five interceptions, to defeat the Houston Texans 26-23. The Lions trailed 23-7 at halftime but rallied as Jake Bates nailed a 52-yard field goal at the buzzer, marking their seventh consecutive win and improving their record to 8-1 for the first time since 1954. Despite Goff's struggles, including three picks by halftime, Detroit's defense held firm, and C.J. Stroud’s second-half interceptions allowed the Lions a comeback opportunity. Bates had previously tied the game with a 58-yard field goal, and David Montgomery and Amon-Ra St. Brown contributed crucial touchdowns. The Texans, who saw rookie Kamari Lassiter set a franchise record for interceptions, couldn't capitalize on Goff's miscues, missing a potential game-winning field goal. The Lions' victory marked the first time since 2012 that a team won despite throwing five or more interceptions in a game.

In an exciting matchup in Munich, the Carolina Panthers edged out the New York Giants 20-17 in overtime, thanks to a game-winning 36-yard field goal by Eddy Pineiro. The Giants had initially won the overtime coin toss, but rookie Tyrone Tracy's fumble, forced by former Giant A'Shawn Robinson, set up the Panthers for the victory. Tracy lamented his mistake, while Robinson relished the chance to make a decisive play in what he described as a thrilling experience in one of Europe's top soccer stadiums. The Giants rallied from a 17-7 fourth-quarter deficit with a 42-yard field goal by Graham Gano, who had returned from a hamstring injury. Despite a commendable comeback attempt led by Daniel Jones, the Giants suffered their fifth consecutive loss. The Panthers' Bryce Young, the top draft pick in 2023, secured his first back-to-back wins in the NFL, alongside standout performances by running back Chuba Hubbard, who rushed for 153 yards. The game also featured an atmospheric note with sights and sounds unique to the venue, such as World Cup winner Manuel Neuer participating in pregame rituals and fans singing "Take Me Home, Country Roads."

Taron Johnson set the tone by intercepting Flacco’s first pass and scoring a 23-yard touchdown. Josh Allen contributed with both a rushing touchdown and 280 passing yards, although he acknowledged the need for a stronger offensive start. Despite the Bills' depleted receiving corps and Allen’s two interceptions, they maintained momentum with key contributions from James Cook and Mack Hollins. Meanwhile, Flacco, despite throwing two touchdowns and accumulating 272 yards, faced criticism for his three interceptions as the Colts dropped to 4-6. The game also saw a physical altercation with Colts' Dayo Odeyingbo during a fourth-down scrum.

Drake Maye outperformed fellow rookie quarterback Williams by leading five scoring drives, despite throwing for just 184 yards with a touchdown and an interception. The Patriots' defense was relentless, sacking Williams nine times, and contributing to the Bears' offensive struggles; Chicago managed only 142 yards and converted just 1 of 14 third downs. This marked the third consecutive loss for the Bears, prompting fans to call for coach Matt Eberflus's dismissal.
