**Phoenix Suns 115 - 102 LA Clippers**  
In a standout game for the Phoenix Suns, newcomer Jalen Green shone in his debut, scoring 29 points and helping secure a 115-102 victory over the short-handed Los Angeles Clippers. Green, returning after a hamstring injury, made an impressive impact by hitting 10 of his 20 shots and 6 of 13 from three-point range in just 23 minutes of play. Devin Booker contributed 24 points, while Grayson Allen, battling an illness, added 18 points. Notably, Phoenix capitalized on a strong third quarter, outscoring the Clippers 40-23 and building a 17-point lead. The Clippers, missing James Harden and Kawhi Leonard, saw Ivica Zubac lead with 23 points and 11 rebounds. Former Sun Bradley Beal struggled for the Clippers, finishing with just five points and facing boos from the Phoenix crowd. The Suns solidified their largest lead with a decisive three-pointer from Allen, and the teams are set for a rematch in Inglewood on Saturday.
