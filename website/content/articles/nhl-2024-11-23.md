**Pittsburgh Penguins 1 - 4 Winnipeg Jets**  
The Winnipeg Jets secured a decisive 4-1 victory over the Pittsburgh Penguins, driven by Kyle Connor’s goal and assist, and additional scores from Nino Niederreiter, Vladislav Namestnikov, and Gabriel Vilardi. Connor Hellebuyck’s 17 saves provided a strong defensive foundation, as the Jets achieved their tenth undefeated game when scoring first, a feat shared only with the New York Rangers in the league. The Penguins struggled, with Sidney Crosby notably held without a shot for a second consecutive game, as his quest for a 600th career goal continues. Tristan Jarry, the Penguins' goalie, allowed an early goal for the fourth time this season, while a rare Gordie Howe Hat Trick from Connor included a skirmish against Crosby. With the Jets' tactical defense causing difficulties for the Penguins, Michael Bunting’s power-play goal was Pittsburgh’s lone score, reflecting their current slump of seven losses in nine games.

**Anaheim Ducks 2 - 3 Buffalo Sabres**  
Jiri Kulich's overtime goal lifted the Buffalo Sabres to a 3-2 victory over the Anaheim Ducks at the Honda Center. In an exciting finish, Kulich scored off a rebound with only a minute left in the extra period, following a save by Ducks' goalie John Gibson during a 2-on-1 break. Despite Anaheim's early lead from Drew Helleson and Isac Lundestrom's goals, the Sabres made a remarkable comeback with Peyton Krebs and Jason Zucker scoring late in the second period to tie the game. Owen Power contributed with three assists, while Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen made 22 saves, helping Buffalo secure their third win in four games. Anaheim, who outshot dramatically by Buffalo in the first period, lost their winning three-game streak despite Gibson's 30 saves.
