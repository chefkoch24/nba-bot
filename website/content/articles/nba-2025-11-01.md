In a thrilling game, the Boston Celtics narrowly defeated the Philadelphia 76ers 109-108, with Jaylen Brown leading the charge with 32 points.

**Phoenix Suns 118 - 96 Utah Jazz**  
In a thrilling prelude to the NBA Cup, the Utah Jazz and Phoenix Suns are set to clash again on Friday, with the Suns eager to avenge their previous overtime loss. Lauri Markkanen of the Jazz continues to impress, averaging 34 points per game and ranking fifth in the league for scoring. Despite their recent struggles, including a narrow defeat to Memphis due to costly turnovers, the Suns are adapting to coach Jordan Ott's fast-paced approach, attempting to resolve their turnover challenges and improve their shooting. Notably, Mark Williams has emerged with consecutive double-doubles, signaling promise in his initial starts. The Jazz recently snapped a 10-game losing streak to the Suns, and Friday's game offers Phoenix a chance to end their own four-game skid. Grouped with powerhouses like Oklahoma City, Minnesota, and Sacramento, both teams are striving for NBA Cup qualification, where the best from each group enter knockout rounds leading to the final on Dec. 16 in Las Vegas.

**Portland Trail Blazers 109 - 107 Denver Nuggets**  
In a closely contested matchup, the Portland Trail Blazers edged out the Denver Nuggets, who came into the game on a three-game winning streak with an average victory margin of 23 points. The spotlight was on Nikola Jokic, who was on the brink of making NBA history by becoming the first player to start a season with five straight triple-doubles. Despite this, Jokic remained focused on team success rather than individual accolades. In their previous game, Jokic's stellar performance of 21 points, 12 rebounds, and 10 assists helped the Nuggets to a comfortable win over the New Orleans Pelicans, where they amassed 40 assists and dominated the boards with a 56-36 rebounding edge. Meanwhile, the Trail Blazers narrowly secured a 136-134 victory over the Utah Jazz, nearly squandering a substantial lead. Jrue Holiday, a recent acquisition, contributed significantly with a season-high 27 points and has been consistently impressive, averaging 19.6 points, 7.8 assists, and 5.4 rebounds. Portland's high-scoring pace was evident, having scored at least 122 points in all their wins, with forward Deni Avdija noting the team's strong identity and effort each night. The teams are part of the NBA Cup's West Group C, alongside the Warriors, Rockets, and Spurs, with each game being crucial in the round-robin competition leading to the championship game in December.

**LA Clippers 126 - 124 New Orleans Pelicans**  
In a thrilling game summary, Kawhi Leonard's buzzer-beater sealed a victory for the Los Angeles Clippers against the New Orleans Pelicans in the NBA Cup opener in Inglewood, California. Despite a previous 98-79 loss to the Golden State Warriors, marking their lowest scoring since October 2021, the Clippers were eager to improve. Their second half performance against the Warriors, riddled with turnovers and missed three-pointers, highlighted the absence of Bradley Beal due to back soreness. Fortunately, Beal is set to return, bringing hope to the Clippers, who boast a strong 2-0 home record. Conversely, the Pelicans are struggling early in the season with a 0-4 record and poor shooting, compounded by injuries to Dejounte Murray and Kevon Looney. Rookie Jeremiah Fears shone with a career-high 21 points against Denver, but the Pelicans are clearly missing consistent teamwork, as noted by head coach Willie Green. Historically, New Orleans has had the upper hand in their Los Angeles matchups, yet this year finds them in a tough position.
