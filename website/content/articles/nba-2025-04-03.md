This victory gave the Cavaliers their 61st win of the season, tying them with the 2009-10 team and securing the second-most wins in franchise history.

**Indiana Pacers 119 - 105 Charlotte Hornets**  
The Indiana Pacers secured a 119-105 victory over the Charlotte Hornets with a standout performance by Tyrese Haliburton, who tallied 22 points and 10 assists. Aaron Nesmith and Pascal Siakam, celebrating his 31st birthday, added 16 and 15 points respectively, while Myles Turner contributed 15 points and nine rebounds. With this win, the playoff-bound Pacers continued their strong finish to the regular season, having won three of their last four games and eight of their last ten. Indiana, aiming for home-court advantage for the first time since 2014, dominated the game with effective three-point shooting and capitalized on Charlotte's 18 turnovers, outscoring them 29-4 in points off turnovers. Despite a brief comeback by the Hornets, who trimmed the deficit to one point in the third quarter, the Pacers regained control with a decisive 19-6 run. The game featured an impressive alley-oop from Haliburton to Obi Toppin, energizing the home crowd as the Pacers built an 87-73 lead in the third quarter. The Hornets, led by Miles Bridges with 18 points, struggled with recent form, having lost six of their last seven games. Both teams will host games on Friday, with Charlotte facing Sacramento and Indiana taking on Utah.

**Washington Wizards 116 - 111 Sacramento Kings**  
The Washington Wizards defeated the Sacramento Kings 116-111 in a tightly contested game, splitting the season series between the teams. Jordan Poole led the Wizards with 23 points, while Bub Carrington and AJ Johnson each contributed 19 points. The Wizards, who shared the league's fewest victories with Utah, managed to overcome their recent three-game losing streak, improving to a beleaguered 8-30 at home. Despite a valiant effort by DeMar DeRozan, who scored 20 of his 29 points in the fourth quarter, the Kings couldn't close a 14-point gap from the third quarter, despite narrowing the score to 111-109 in the final minute. Domantas Sabonis added 18 points and 16 rebounds for Sacramento, but the team struggled from the three-point line, making only 10 of 39 attempts. The loss extends the Kings' losing streak to three games during their final six-game road trip, jeopardizing their play-in tournament hopes, while the Wizards snapped their losing streak by shooting 17 of 43 from beyond the arc.

**Boston Celtics 103 - 124 Miami Heat**  
The Miami Heat extended their season-best winning streak to six games by defeating the Boston Celtics 124-103, thanks to Tyler Herro's 25 points and nine assists, as well as Bam Adebayo's 21 points. Seven Heat players scored in double figures despite missing key players such as Andrew Wiggins, Duncan Robinson, and Kevin Love. This victory rounded off a perfect 3-0 road trip for the Heat, who rebounded impressively after a 10-game losing streak in the previous month. Meanwhile, the Celtics, led by Jaylen Brown's 24 points, saw their nine-game winning streak halted, even as they managed to rally within four points in the fourth quarter. Miami's decisive 22-9 run late in the game solidified their cushion. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra earned his 785th regular-season win, surpassing Gene Shue for 17th on the NBA's all-time list. The Heat look poised as playoff threats, exhibiting depth and adaptability in their roster.

**Houston Rockets 143 - 105 Utah Jazz**  
The Houston Rockets secured a playoff spot with a commanding 143-105 victory over the Utah Jazz, marking their 50th win of the season—a milestone they last achieved during the 2018-19 season. Jalen Green led the Rockets with 22 points, while Dillon Brooks added 21, and Jabari Smith Jr. contributed a double-double with 15 points and 14 rebounds off the bench. Despite missing Fred VanVleet due to knee and ankle soreness, Houston shot an impressive 54% from the field and dominated the boards with a 63-39 rebounding edge, leading to a significant 23-6 advantage in second-chance points. Notably, Dillon Brooks received his 16th potential technical foul in the first quarter, putting him at risk of suspension for an upcoming game if not rescinded. On the other hand, Utah's struggles continued as they suffered their seventh consecutive loss, dropping to a worrisome 1-17 since late February.

**Oklahoma City Thunder 119 - 103 Detroit Pistons**  
The Oklahoma City Thunder secured their 11th straight victory with a 145-117 triumph over the Chicago Bulls, setting an NBA record for the most wins against the opposite conference at 28-1. This streak places the Thunder (63-12) just one win away from tying the single-season franchise record for consecutive wins set by the 1995-96 Seattle SuperSonics. Thunder guard Isaiah Joe played a pivotal role, scoring 31 points and continuing his impressive shooting from beyond the arc, hitting 53.2 percent of his 3-pointers over the last eight games. The Detroit Pistons, dealing with suspensions after a skirmish with the Minnesota Timberwolves, potentially face playing without key players like Isaiah Stewart, Ron Holland II, Marcus Sasser, and Cade Cunningham for their next matchup against Oklahoma City. Despite these challenges, Pistons coach J.B. Bickerstaff praised his team's resilience and the leadership of Cunningham, who remains doubtful with a calf injury.

**Dallas Mavericks 120 - 118 Atlanta Hawks**  
Anthony Davis delivered a standout performance for the Dallas Mavericks, scoring a season-high 34 points and securing 15 rebounds in their narrow 120-118 victory over the Atlanta Hawks. His decisive driving floater with 3.4 seconds left sealed the win despite having to sit out much of the second quarter due to an eye injury caused by an accidental elbow from teammate Daniel Gafford. Klay Thompson contributed 17 points, while Spencer Dinwiddie stepped up in Kyrie Irving's absence, recording 14 points and 10 assists. The Mavericks, sitting ninth in the Western Conference, overcame an 11-point deficit in the third quarter, shooting an impressive 53% from the field. On the opposing side, Trae Young, who was limited to 25 points and 12 assists, saw his final 3-point attempt fall short as Atlanta's shooting woes continued, converting only 43.3% of their field goals. Notably, Young's scoring average against Dallas remains his lowest against any team, as Dallas looks ahead to their game against the Los Angeles Clippers.

**Denver Nuggets 106 - 113 San Antonio Spurs**  
The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Denver Nuggets 113-106 in a game marked by Harrison Barnes scoring 20 points to lead six Spurs players in double figures. Despite missing key players Victor Wembanyama and De'Aaron Fox, the Spurs capitalized on Denver resting all five starters after a grueling double-overtime loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves. Jaylen Pickett shone for Denver with his first career triple-double, notching 17 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists, while Russell Westbrook contributed 30 points but faltered in the fourth quarter, missing a crucial reverse layup that could have tied the game. Blake Wesley and Sandro Mamukelashvili helped secure the Spurs' victory with critical baskets in the final minutes. Notably, Chris Paul hit back-to-back threes to extend San Antonio's lead. Denver's reserves, despite clawing back from a 20-point deficit, failed to seize victory as they prepared to visit the Golden State Warriors next.

**LA Clippers 114 - 98 New Orleans Pelicans**  
The Los Angeles Clippers are looking to secure a top-six playoff spot in the Western Conference as they prepare to host the struggling New Orleans Pelicans. The Clippers aim for their 12th win in 15 games, sitting at a pivotal seventh-best record and closely trailing the Golden State Warriors and Memphis Grizzlies. With the potential to finish anywhere between fifth and eighth, the Clippers are keen to avoid the play-in tournament. Kawhi Leonard has been instrumental, averaging 25.2 points through March, while Norman Powell contributed significantly with 55 points in the last two games. Meanwhile, the Pelicans, beset by injuries and having shut down key players Zion Williamson and CJ McCollum for the season, are already eliminated from playoff contention. Despite having used 42 different starting lineups due to injuries, the Pelicans secured a recent victory against the Charlotte Hornets without head coach Willie Green. It’s a tumultuous time for the Pelicans, who are trying to avoid their worst season since 2012-13.
