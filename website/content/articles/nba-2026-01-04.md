**Golden State Warriors 123 - 114 Utah Jazz**  
The Golden State Warriors suffered a decisive 131-94 defeat to the Oklahoma City Thunder, largely due to the absence of key players like Stephen Curry, Jimmy Butler, and Draymond Green, who were sidelined for various reasons including rest and health issues.

Despite only having ten healthy players, Pat Spencer managed a significant contribution with a game-high 11 assists. The Warriors, previously successful against the Utah Jazz, hoped for a better performance in their upcoming matchup back home. Meanwhile, the Jazz faced similar troubles, coping with injuries to Lauri Markkanen and illness affecting Keyonte George, leading to an increased role for Brice Sensabaugh, who scored 20 points in a recent loss to the Clippers.
