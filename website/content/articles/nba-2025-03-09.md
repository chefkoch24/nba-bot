The Orlando Magic ended their five-game losing streak by defeating the Milwaukee Bucks 111-109, halting Milwaukee's four-game winning streak. Paolo Banchero led the Magic with 29 points, while Cole Anthony contributed 22.

The game concluded dramatically when Milwaukee's Damian Lillard missed a potential game-winning three-pointer at the buzzer. Giannis Antetokounmpo starred for the Bucks with 37 points and 11 rebounds, while Lillard added 26, but it wasn't enough as the Magic's bench players, including Anthony Black with 11 points, provided crucial support. Orlando, struggling at home recently, managed to secure this victory as they began their five-game road stretch. In contrast, the Bucks, facing a challenging upcoming schedule, narrowly missed a chance to win at the finish despite coming off a successful run and being bolstered by a potential possession reversal following a successful challenge by Magic coach Jamahl Mosley.

**Boston Celtics 111 - 101 Los Angeles Lakers**  
The Boston Celtics overcame a late rally by the Los Angeles Lakers to secure a 111-101 victory, led by Jayson Tatum's impressive performance with 40 points, 12 rebounds, and eight assists. Despite LeBron James leaving the game with a strained groin after contributing 22 points, the Lakers managed to cut a 20-point deficit to single digits. However, Celtics stars Tatum and Jaylen Brown, who added 31 points, ensured the win by scoring Boston's final 12 points. The Celtics, celebrating their fourth consecutive victory, benefited from a strong defensive third quarter, holding the Lakers to just 21% shooting and forcing six turnovers. Notably, Jrue Holiday returned to the lineup following an injury while Kristaps Porzingis remained out with an illness. A highlight came in the first quarter when Al Horford completed a two-handed slam after Brown's steal, though an inadvertent knee to Luka Doncic's head left the latter visibly irritated. The Lakers, whose eight-game winning streak in Los Angeles was snapped, will next face the Brooklyn Nets, while the Celtics prepare to host the Utah Jazz.
