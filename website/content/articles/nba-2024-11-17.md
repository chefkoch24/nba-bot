**Boston Celtics 126 - 123 Toronto Raptors**  
Jayson Tatum secured a thrilling victory for the Boston Celtics with a buzzer-beating 3-pointer in overtime, leading them to a 126-123 win over the Toronto Raptors. Tatum contributed a double-double with 24 points and 11 rebounds, while Jaylen Brown topped Boston's scoring with 27 points. Al Horford and Derrick White each added 18 points. Despite a career-high 35-point performance from Jakob Poeltl and 25 points from RJ Barrett, the Raptors extended their losing streak to seven games and are yet to win on the road this season. The game saw crucial moments, including Boston's Neemias Queta stepping in for the injured Jrue Holiday and making key plays, and Toronto winning a critical coachâ€™s challenge late in the game. Notably, Bruno Fernando sustained an injury but was able to return, while the Celtics improved to an 11-3 record, avoiding another home loss at TD Garden. After this game, the Raptors are set to face the Indiana Pacers, and the Celtics will continue NBA Cup play against the Cleveland Cavaliers.

**Dallas Mavericks 110 - 93 San Antonio Spurs**  
The Dallas Mavericks ended their four-game losing streak with a 110-93 victory over the San Antonio Spurs, capitalizing on the absence of Spurs' star center Victor Wembanyama due to a knee bruise. Both Kyrie Irving, returning from a shoulder sprain, and Daniel Gafford led the Mavericks with 22 points each. The team's bench contributed a season-high 54 points. While Mavericks' Luka Doncic, who is sixth in the NBA for scoring, had a modest 16 points, his lowest season performance, he also added six rebounds and assists in limited minutes. San Antonio's Zach Collins stepped in for Wembanyama and achieved a season-high 20 points, but the Spurs struggled, particularly being outscored 46-22 in the paint through three quarters and 38-18 in the pivotal third quarter. The Mavericks now head to Oklahoma City to complete their back-to-back games, while the Spurs begin a homestand against Oklahoma City in an NBA Cup game.

**Sacramento Kings 121 - 117 Utah Jazz**  
In an exhilarating matchup, Sacramento's De'Aaron Fox delivered an impressive performance, scoring 49 points against the Utah Jazz following his franchise-record 60-point game in an overtime loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves. Despite the absence of Malik Monk and DeMar DeRozan, Fox nearly led the Kings to a comeback from a 20-point deficit, scoring 39 points in the second half alone. Domantas Sabonis contributed a double-double with 23 points and 12 rebounds, while Keegan Murray added 14 points and 10 rebounds. Sacramento looks to extend its winning streak against Utah, having already defeated them earlier this season. Utah's John Collins and rookie standout Kyle Filipowski have shown strong performances, with Filipowski stepping up in the absence of Walker Kessler. The Jazz recently eked out a narrow victory over the Dallas Mavericks, bolstered by Collins' late-game heroics and Filipowski's defensive prowess against Luka Doncic.
