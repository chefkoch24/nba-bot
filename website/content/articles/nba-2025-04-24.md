**Cleveland Cavaliers 121 - 112 Miami Heat**  
The Cleveland Cavaliers claimed a 2-0 lead in their first-round Eastern Conference series with a 121-112 victory over the Miami Heat, thanks largely to Donovan Mitchell's decisive performance. Mitchell scored 30 points, including 17 in the fourth quarter, to thwart a Miami comeback attempt. His clutch play in the closing moments allowed the Cavaliers to maintain their lead after Miami had narrowed the gap to just two points. Mitchell's contribution was instrumental, as he also provided six rebounds and six assists, highlighting his status as a superstar capable of taking over games. The Cavaliers set a new NBA playoff record with 11 three-pointers in the second quarter and finished with 22, tied for the sixth most ever in a playoff game. Tyler Herro led Miami with 33 points, but it wasn't enough to overcome Cleveland's hot shooting and Mitchell's heroics. The Heat, who led early and rallied in the third quarter, will look to regroup as they host Game 3 on Saturday.

**Boston Celtics 109 - 100 Orlando Magic**  
The Boston Celtics took a 2-0 series lead in their first-round playoff matchup against the Orlando Magic with a 109-100 victory, despite missing All-Star Jayson Tatum due to a wrist injury. Jaylen Brown stepped up with an impressive performance, scoring 36 points and adding 10 rebounds and five assists, while Kristaps Porzingis contributed 20 points after returning from an injury that required five stitches. Orlando's Paolo Banchero led his team with 32 points, as Boston maintained control with consistent scoring and a strong defensive display, highlighted by 12 three-pointers and 25 successful free throws. Tensions were high due to physical play, including Porzingis receiving a flagrant foul after an elbow from Goga Bitadze, and friction involving Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, who was involved in both a controversial foul on Tatum in Game 1 and a tripping incident with Al Horford. The Celtics' resilience without Tatum underscores their depth as they head to Game 3 in Orlando.

**Houston Rockets 109 - 94 Golden State Warriors**  
In Game 2 of their playoff series, the Houston Rockets managed to even the series 1-1 against the Golden State Warriors, driven by their need for increased offensive output after losing Game 1, 95-85. Despite dominating the glass with 22 offensive rebounds to the Warriors’ six, the Rockets struggled to convert these into second-chance points, highlighted by their poor shooting percentage of 39.1% compared to Golden State’s 47.4%. Stephen Curry was pivotal for the Warriors, scoring 31 points and hitting key 3-pointers, while Houston's bench, including Jabari Smith Jr.'s 11 points and six rebounds, fueled a late comeback attempt. As the series progresses, Houston's new core, featuring Jalen Green and Alperen Sengün, faces the challenge of overcoming a Warriors team that has historically eliminated them from the playoffs. Jimmy Butler, newly acquired by Golden State, has been instrumental alongside Curry, contributing significantly to the team's Game 1 victory and maintaining the Warriors’ competitive edge.
