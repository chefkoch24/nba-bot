**Golden State Warriors 109 - 128 Oklahoma City Thunder**  
Isaiah Joe went a perfect 7 for 7 on 3-pointers, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 24 points with 7 assists, and the Oklahoma City Thunder recorded 31 assists in a dominant 128-109 victory over a short-handed Golden State Warriors team on Thursday night. The Thunder made 59.4% of their 3-point attempts to hand the Warriors their fifth straight loss, as Stephen Curry and Draymond Green were unavailable and Gary Payton II exited with a sprained ankle. Despite Golden State grabbing 20 offensive rebounds, the Thunder's balanced scoring and ball movement propelled them to victory. Jonathan Kuminga led the Warriors with 21 points, while rookie Chet Holmgren had a double-double for Oklahoma City. The Thunder's win marked their fifth in six games, as they look forward to a rematch with the Warriors on Saturday at Chase Center.
