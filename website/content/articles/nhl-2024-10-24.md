**Washington Capitals 6 - 3 Philadelphia Flyers**  
The Washington Capitals clinched their fifth consecutive victory by defeating the Philadelphia Flyers 6-3 at Capital One Arena, with Connor McMichael scoring twice in a brief 3:12 stretch during the second period. Alex Ovechkin contributed an empty-netter for his 855th career goal, moving closer to Wayne Gretzky's NHL record of 894. Despite a late comeback from the Flyers, sparked by goals from Matvei Michkov and Owen Tippett, the efforts fell short. Michkov, noteworthy for his goal and assist, became the first Flyers rookie since 2009-10 to tally seven points in his first seven games. Capitals' Pierre-Luc Dubois had a goal and two assists, while Dylan Strome extended his point streak to six games, further highlighting the team's strong offensive performance. The Flyers' Jamie Drysdale and coach John Tortorella commended Michkovâ€™s offensive prowess, pointing to potential for future games.
