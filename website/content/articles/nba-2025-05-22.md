**New York Knicks 135 - 138 Indiana Pacers**  
In a thrilling Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals, the Indiana Pacers staged a dramatic comeback to defeat the New York Knicks 138-135 in overtime. Trailing by 14 points with under three minutes left in regulation, the Pacers mounted an impressive rally led by Aaron Nesmith, who nailed a series of late 3-pointers. Tyrese Haliburton tied the game at the buzzer with a long jumper, sending it to overtime after replay confirmed his toe was on the line. Andrew Nembhard scored the go-ahead basket in OT, sealing the victory. The game marked the first Eastern Conference finals appearance for the Knicks since 2000, but they failed to maintain their lead, missing an opportunity to protect their unblemished record in equivalent situations since the 1997-98 season. Haliburton ended with 31 points and 11 assists, while Nesmith contributed 30 points. For the Knicks, Jalen Brunson and Karl-Anthony Towns shone with 43 and 35 points respectively, but even their efforts couldn't prevent the collapse. The Pacers' comeback echoed their recent postseason heroics against Milwaukee and Cleveland, offering a tough start to this classic rivalry series, with Game 2 set for Friday night.
