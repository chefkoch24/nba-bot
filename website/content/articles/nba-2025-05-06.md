**Boston Celtics 105 - 108 New York Knicks**  
In a thrilling start to their Eastern Conference semifinal series, the New York Knicks overcame a 20-point second-half deficit to stun the defending NBA champion Boston Celtics with a 108-105 overtime victory. Jalen Brunson and OG Anunoby each scored 29 points for the Knicks, with Anunoby's clutch plays including a crucial steal and game-winning three-pointer in overtime. Mikal Bridges capped the Knicks' comeback by intercepting an inbounds pass from Jaylen Brown in the final second, securing New York's first win against their longtime rivals after losing all four regular-season games against them. Despite Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brownâ€™s 23 points each, the Celtics faltered with a playoff-record 45 missed three-pointers, finishing only 15 of 60 from beyond the arc. Boston's efforts were further hampered by Kristaps Porzingis' absence due to illness, impacting their game strategy. With Game 2 set for Wednesday, the Celtics aim to adjust and recover following this unexpected loss, as the Knicks aim to build on their momentum without relying on a fixed strategy.

**Oklahoma City Thunder 119 - 121 Denver Nuggets**  
In a dramatic Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinals, the Denver Nuggets and Oklahoma City Thunder faced off in Oklahoma City. Despite contrasting schedules, with the Nuggets recovering from a taxing seven-game series and the Thunder enjoying a nine-day break, the game promised excitement featuring two of the three NBA MVP finalists: Oklahoma City's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Denver's Nikola Jokic. Gilgeous-Alexander, after a stellar recovery in the first round against Memphis, and Jokic, known for his triple-doubles, were pivotal in their teams' ambitions to advance further than last year's second-round eliminations. The return of Russell Westbrook, a pivotal figure in the Thunder's playoff history, added another layer of intrigue, as he demonstrated enduring impact off the bench. The teams split their regular-season games, and with the Nuggets' surprising decision to fire coach Michael Malone late in the season, both teams prepared for a compelling series dictated by new dynamics and individual performances.
