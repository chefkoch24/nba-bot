In a decisive home victory, the Detroit Pistons triumphed over the New York Knicks 121-90, led by Cade Cunningham who notched an impressive 29 points and 13 assists. This win marked a significant milestone for the Pistons as it ended their NBA-record 15-game postseason losing streak against the Knicks, following their playoff elimination by New York earlier this year. Javonte Green and Jaden Ivey also contributed with 17 and 16 points respectively. Despite Jalen Brunson's 25-point effort, the Knicks suffered their fourth consecutive defeat, with limited support as only Miles McBride (17) and Mikal Bridges (10) reached double figures.

**Boston Celtics 115 - 101 Chicago Bulls**  
The Boston Celtics secured a commanding 115-101 victory over the Chicago Bulls, buoyed by Anfernee Simons' 27 points and Payton Pritchard’s 21. Boston's defensive prowess was on full display, limiting the Bulls to just 33 points in the first half—the fewest Boston has allowed in any first half this season. Despite a recent 50-point performance, Jaylen Brown managed only 14 points on 6-of-24 shooting. Neemias Queta contributed a strong double-double with 13 points and 13 rebounds, helping the Celtics to their eighth win in nine games. Matas Buzelis led the Bulls with 26 points, but Chicago struggled offensively, missing leading scorer Josh Giddey due to a hamstring injury and nearly breaking their team record for the fewest points in a half. The Celtics maintained a strong lead throughout, with a late push from the Bulls cutting the gap but never fully threatening Boston's advantage.

**Houston Rockets 100 - 97 Phoenix Suns**  
Kevin Durant's dramatic 3-pointer with 1.1 seconds remaining secured a 100-97 victory for the Houston Rockets over the Phoenix Suns on Monday night. This marked a significant moment as the former Suns player joined the Rockets in a major trade over the summer. The Suns had a chance to take the lead before Durant's decisive shot but failed to score, leading to a thrilling end. Despite an impressive 27-point performance from Devin Booker, the Suns' two-game winning streak was halted. The Rockets, with contributions from Amen Thompson and Jabari Smith Jr., notched their fifth win in six games. Notably, the game faced a brief delay due to clock and scoreboard malfunctions, and Houston’s Alperen Sengun was absent due to injury.

**Oklahoma City Thunder 97 - 124 Charlotte Hornets**  
In a surprising upset, the Charlotte Hornets defeated the NBA-leading Oklahoma City Thunder 124-97, thanks to Brandon Miller's impressive 28-point performance and Kon Knueppel's 23 points. The loss marked Oklahoma City's worst of the season and their first game failing to reach 100 points, despite Shai Gilgeous-Alexander extending his streak of scoring at least 20 points to 108 games. Notably, Gilgeous-Alexander, usually rested in fourth quarters due to big leads, sat out because the Thunder were trailing significantly. The Thunder, starting the season 24-1, faced their second consecutive loss and home defeat, falling to a 30-7 record. Charlotte led early with a 21-9 run, spurred by Ajay Mitchell's contributions off the bench for OKC, but reclaimed a substantial lead by halftime. A highlight came when LaMelo Ball made a circus shot to widen the gap in the third quarter, and Miller capped the period with a buzzer-beating three-pointer to secure the Hornets' control. Charlotte will host the Toronto Raptors next, while the Thunder face the Utah Jazz.

**Philadelphia 76ers 124 - 125 Denver Nuggets**  
In a thrilling overtime game, the Denver Nuggets overcame the Philadelphia 76ers with a narrow 125-124 victory, marked by a decisive goaltending call against Joel Embiid in the final seconds. Despite missing key players, including three-time MVP Nikola Jokic, the short-handed Nuggets showed resilience, with Jalen Pickett leading the charge with 29 points and Peyton Watson contributing 24. Bruce Brown, who scored 19 points, was pivotal in overtime, netting the winning bucket after Embiid's attempt to block his layup resulted in a goaltend. The Nuggets, playing with only nine available players, refused to be daunted by their depleted lineup and mounted a significant 14-0 run in the fourth quarter. The Sixers' Embiid and Tyrese Maxey combined for 60 points, with Maxey narrowly missing a game-winner at the buzzer. VJ Edgecombe, having an impressive rookie season, kept the Sixers competitive with crucial plays, but it wasn't enough to prevent Denver's upset win.

**LA Clippers 103 - 102 Golden State Warriors**  
The Los Angeles Clippers and Golden State Warriors, both on upward trajectories despite recent setbacks, clashed on Monday night. The Warriors, recovering from a heavy defeat against the Oklahoma City Thunder and an eventful win over the Jazz, faced their sole away game amid a home-heavy schedule. While the Warriors boast stars like Stephen Curry, who has excelled since his return from injury, much attention was given to Buddy Hield. Despite being benched frequently, he was praised by coach Steve Kerr and Draymond Green for his positive influence on team dynamics. In contrast, the Clippers, once struggling early in the season, experienced a resurgence led by Kawhi Leonard and James Harden's stellar performances, which bolstered their standings. While Leonard remains focused on improving the team's performance, he's not yet considering playoff prospects, highlighting the ongoing need for individual and collective growth.

**Portland Trail Blazers 137 - 117 Utah Jazz**  
The Portland Trail Blazers secured a 115-110 victory over the San Antonio Spurs, showcasing their strong recent form, as they have won four of their last five games. Donovan Clingan excelled with a career-high 24 points and 12 rebounds, setting the pace for Portland by scoring the team's first 11 points. Deni Avdija celebrated his 25th birthday with a triple-double, contributing 29 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists, while Toumani Camara added 20 points, hitting five 3-pointers. Portland looks to maintain their momentum with eight of their next ten games at home, beginning with a matchup against the Utah Jazz, whom they narrowly defeated 136-134 earlier this season. Despite Lauri Markkanen's impressive 35-point outing, the Jazz have struggled, losing three straight and falling in seven of their last nine games. Kevin Love, recently showing flashes of his early-career form, continues to contribute significantly for the Jazz as they miss the presence of Jusuf Nurkic due to injury.
