In a thrilling game, Nikola Jokic led the Denver Nuggets to a 130-124 victory over the Sacramento Kings, scoring a season-high 34 points and providing 14 assists. Although Jokic recorded only four rebounds, a season low, he maintained his streak of at least a double-double in all six games so far. The Nuggets have now defeated the Kings six consecutive times since the 2023-24 season. Despite Russell Westbrook's impressive performance of 26 points and 12 rebounds against his former team, Sacramento fell short. Seven Kings players scored in double digits, but Zach LaVine struggled, finishing with a season-low 15 points. Westbrook, who played for Denver during the 2024-25 season, was warmly recognized by the crowd, with Nuggets coach David Adelman commending his playoff contributions. Jokic's return to the court in the final quarter proved pivotal, as he made crucial plays to extend Denver's lead and secure the win. Additionally, Christian Braun rebounded from a poor outing with a season-high 21 points. Denver now looks to continue their four-game homestand against Miami on Wednesday, while Sacramento will host Golden State.

**Portland Trail Blazers 115 - 123 Los Angeles Lakers**  
Following their recent 122-108 road win, the Portland Trail Blazers will seek to defeat the Los Angeles Lakers again as they host them this Monday night. Portland comes off a narrow 109-107 home win against the Denver Nuggets, demonstrating resilience by erasing a 10-point deficit and securing victory with Jerami Grant’s clutch free throws. Deni Avdija, averaging 22.7 points, has been a consistent performer, scoring 20+ points in five of six games, while the Lakers, fresh off a 130-120 victory over the Miami Heat, are riding a three-game win streak. Luka Doncic made history with 165 points in his first four games of the season, overshadowing Jerry West's long-standing record, though he admitted alongside teammate Austin Reaves that their shooting could improve. The Lakers' lineup was bolstered by standout performances from Reaves and the emerging Jake LaRavia, while Portland faces uncertainty with Blake Wesley's foot injury and Deandre Ayton’s back problems impacting his availability. As both teams show impressive form and character, a compelling matchup is anticipated.

**LA Clippers 119 - 120 Miami Heat**  
In an exciting matchup, the Miami Heat narrowly defeated the Los Angeles Clippers at home, continuing their quest for a perfect home record early in the season. The Clippers previously celebrated a thrilling 126-124 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans, thanks to Kawhi Leonard's buzzer-beating jumper, but expressed concerns over their defensive performance, having let slip a 10-point fourth-quarter lead. Leonard shone with a season-best 34 points, while James Harden contributed 24 points and 14 assists. Despite their victory over the Pelicans, the Clippers aim to improve their late-game defense, as emphasized by head coach Tyronn Lue. The Heat played commendably against the Lakers, with Jaime Jaquez Jr. scoring a season-high 31 points off the bench. As the Heat await the return of Tyler Herro and possibly Norman Powell—who seeks redemption against his former team—the matchup against the Clippers promises high stakes and emotions, particularly for Powell who was traded after expecting a contract extension with Los Angeles.
