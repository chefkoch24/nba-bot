**New Orleans Pelicans 112 - 104 LA Clippers**  
In a pivotal game for playoff seeding, Zion Williamson scored 34 points to lead the New Orleans Pelicans to a 112-104 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers, pulling within two games of the No. 4 seed in the Western Conference.

Williamson's dominant performance, including a game-winning floater at the buzzer, showcased his ability to take over games down the stretch. The Pelicans also excelled defensively, with Herb Jones's crucial block leading to a breakaway basket. The Clippers played without James Harden and could not overcome the Pelicans' strong play in the paint. George scored 26 points and Leonard had 23 for Los Angeles, but it wasn't enough. The Pelicans will host the Portland Trail Blazers next, while the Clippers will host the Atlanta Hawks.
