**Atlanta Hawks 124 - 118 Indiana Pacers**  
In a thrilling game, the Atlanta Hawks broke their five-game losing streak against the Indiana Pacers with a 124-118 victory, thanks in large part to Trae Young's remarkable 22 points and 16 assists.

Despite Pascal Siakam's impressive 35-point performance and an 11-0 run late in the third quarter, the Pacers couldn't hold onto their lead without key players Tyrese Haliburton and Bennedict Mathurin due to injuries. Atlanta capitalized by outscoring Indiana 38-24 in the final quarter. Hawks' Coach Quin Snyder returned to the sidelines after an absence due to illness, as the team secured only their third win in the last nine games.
