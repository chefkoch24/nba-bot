**Chicago Blackhawks 3 - 5 New Jersey Devils**  
The New Jersey Devils ended their three-game losing streak with a 5-3 win against the Chicago Blackhawks, driven by Dawson Mercer's two goals and Luke Hughes' three assists. Nathan Bastian scored the opening goal after being a healthy scratch in their previous game, adding depth to the Devils' offensive efforts. Despite strong plays from the Blackhawks, including Tyler Bertuzziâ€™s power-play goal and notable saves from Spencer Knight, their rally fell short as the Devils secured victory. Artyom Levshunov made notable contributions with two assists for Chicago, while Stefan Noesen sealed the game with an empty-net goal, reaching his first 20-goal season milestone. The Devils now find themselves nine points ahead of the New York Islanders in the Metropolitan Division standings.

**Edmonton Oilers 3 - 4 Dallas Stars**  
In an exciting NHL matchup, Jason Robertson scored a natural hat trick in the second period, leading the Dallas Stars to a 4-3 victory over the Edmonton Oilers at Rogers Place. Robertson's impressive performance marked his second hat trick of the season and his fifth in the NHL. The Stars, with the help of goals from Robertson and Wyatt Johnston and multiple assists from Roope Hintz and Thomas Harley, extended their winning streak to three games and a six-game point streak, moving five points ahead of the Colorado Avalanche in the Central Division. Jake Oettinger played a key role with 42 saves. Despite a late rally by Edmonton, including goals from Corey Perry, Adam Henrique, and Zach Hyman, the Oilers fell short, ending their five-game point streak. Edmonton's lineup suffered from the absence of star players Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl due to injuries, and goaltender Stuart Skinner left the game after being inadvertently kneed in the head, prompting Calvin Pickard to step in and finish the game.

**Anaheim Ducks 6 - 2 Boston Bruins**  
Leo Carlsson led the Anaheim Ducks to a commanding 6-2 victory over the Boston Bruins at the Honda Center, scoring two goals including a shorthanded one that opened the scoring. Jackson LaCombe added a goal and an assist while Alex Killorn contributed two assists, and John Gibson stopped 23 shots, helping the Ducks, with a record of 31-32-8, claim their second win in three games. In contrast, the Bruins, with a 30-34-9 record, faced their seventh consecutive game without a win, reminiscent of a 10-game skid in 2010. Morgan Geekie contributed a goal and an assist for Boston, and David Pastrnak netted his 35th of the season during a 5-on-3 power play. Despite good efforts from Joonas Korpisalo, who made 31 saves, the game slipped away for the Bruins, as unfortunate deflections and timely goals from Anaheim, including those from Mason McTavish and Cutter Gauthier, sealed Boston's fate.
