**Pittsburgh Steelers 18 - 16 Baltimore Ravens**  
In a closely contested AFC North matchup, the Pittsburgh Steelers once again outmaneuvered the Baltimore Ravens, prevailing 18-16. Despite Lamar Jackson and the NFL's top-ranked offense, the Ravens struggled, hampered by 12 penalties and three turnovers, all leading to Steelers' kicker Chris Boswell tying a franchise record with six field goals. Jackson completed 16 of 33 passes for 207 yards, connecting with Zay Flowers for a late touchdown, but a failed two-point conversion sealed the Ravens' fate. The Steelers' defense, highlighted by Payton Wilson's critical fourth-quarter interception, effectively contained Jackson, who is now 1-4 against Pittsburgh. Derrick Henry scored his 15th rushing touchdown of the season but was limited to 65 yards, while costly mistakes, including missed field goals by Justin Tucker, added to Baltimore's woes.

**Detroit Lions 52 - 6 Jacksonville Jaguars**  
The Detroit Lions delivered a commanding 52-6 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars, marking their largest winning margin in franchise history and extending their NFC-best record to 9-1. Jared Goff excelled with a perfect passer rating, contributing 412 yards and four touchdown passes, two of which went to Amon-Ra St. Brown, who extended his franchise record with a touchdown catch in eight consecutive games. The Lions amassed a franchise-record 645 total yards and a 475-yard margin over the Jaguars, one of the largest in NFL history. Defensively, newly acquired Za'Darius Smith made an impact with a sack, while Kerby Joseph secured his seventh interception of the season. Jacksonville struggled in Trevor Lawrence's absence, with backup Mac Jones throwing for just 138 yards and an interception. The loss puts additional pressure on Jaguars' coach Doug Pederson, whose future with the team seems uncertain as they head into a bye week with a disappointing 2-9 record.

**Buffalo Bills 30 - 21 Kansas City Chiefs**  
In a dramatic NFL showdown, the Buffalo Bills defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 30-21, ending the Chiefs' hopes for a perfect season. The highlight of the game came late in the fourth quarter when Bills quarterback Josh Allen secured the victory with a stunning 26-yard rushing touchdown on fourth-and-2, giving Buffalo a decisive two-score lead. This win bolstered the Bills' bid for the AFC's top seed and extended their regular-season winning streak against the Chiefs, who had previously halted Buffalo's playoff runs. Allen's impressive performance, which included both passing and rushing touchdowns, was instrumental in the Bills' sixth consecutive victory, further solidifying their position as AFC East leaders. Meanwhile, the Chiefs, who had been unbeaten and had a 15-game winning streak, struggled to overcome Buffalo's pressure, marking their worst offensive output of the season. Despite the setback, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes remained optimistic, emphasizing the need to learn and improve moving forward.

Despite the loss, Bengals' Joe Burrow impressed with 356 passing yards and three touchdowns, though his last efforts were thwarted by the Chargers’ defense, notably Derwin James Jr., who deflected a potential game-tying Hail Mary aimed at Tee Higgins. Higgins and Ja’Marr Chase both had standout performances for Cincinnati, with Higgins catching nine passes for 148 yards and Chase contributing 75 yards and two touchdowns. The Bengals mounted a strong comeback from 27-6 down, scoring on three consecutive drives, but fell short as kicker Evan McPherson missed two crucial field goals in the fourth quarter.

In an exciting contest at Foxborough, Massachusetts, the Los Angeles Rams defeated the New England Patriots 28-22, largely thanks to Matthew Stafford's four touchdown passes, propelling him past Eli Manning to 10th on the NFL's all-time list with 370 career TDs.

Puka Nacua also played a pivotal role, catching seven passes for 123 yards and one touchdown after a fumble recovery. Despite the Patriots’ effort, highlighted by a surprising touchdown from offensive lineman Vederian Lowe, they couldn't capitalize on tighter opportunities, hindered by a missed extra-point block and a late-game interception.

Bo Nix delivered an impressive performance in the Denver Broncos' 38-6 victory over the Atlanta Falcons, completing 85% of his passes for 307 yards and a career-high four touchdowns. The game was marked by Javonte Williams' notable 14-yard touchdown run, where he overcame former teammate Justin Simmons with the help of several Broncos teammates, encapsulating the team's determination after the previous week's loss to Kansas City. Nix joined the ranks of Peyton Manning and Dak Prescott as one of the only rookies to achieve specific passing milestones, underscoring his promising potential. Meanwhile, former Bronco Simmons had a challenging return to Denver as the Broncos ended a two-game losing streak and swept the NFC South with a cumulative 125-37 score. The Falcons, now on a two-game skid, suffered further setbacks with several player injuries throughout the game.

**San Francisco 49ers 17 - 20 Seattle Seahawks**  
In an exhilarating finish, Geno Smith led the Seattle Seahawks to a 20-17 victory over the San Francisco 49ers with a decisive 13-yard touchdown scramble in the final seconds. Smith's late heroics not only snapped the Seahawks' six-game losing streak against San Francisco but also helped keep their playoff hopes alive, improving their record to 5-5. Jaxon Smith-Njigba contributed with 10 receptions for 110 yards, while Kenneth Walker III added a 1-yard touchdown run. The 49ers, now tied with Seattle and the Rams for second in the NFC West, had previously secured a lead through Brock Purdy's 30-yard touchdown pass to Jauan Jennings. However, the absence of injured star defender Nick Bosa proved costly as Seattle capitalized in the closing moments. Both teams now look to regroup for their upcoming games, with the Seahawks set to host the Cardinals and the 49ers visiting the Packers.

Richardson, the No. 4 overall pick in the previous year's NFL draft, ran for two touchdowns, including the game-winning 4-yard run with 46 seconds left. Despite being forced to fumble earlier by Javon Kinlaw, Richardson showcased resilience, connecting with Alec Pierce and Josh Downs on critical plays leading to his decisive score. Meanwhile, Rodgers, battling under interim coach Jeff Ulbrich, struggled despite his two touchdown passes, as the Jets dropped their seventh game in eight outings. Notably, Richardson, the NFL's second-youngest starting QB, outperformed Rodgers, the oldest at 40, displaying newfound poise that suggests his benching was a crucial learning moment. The win snapped the Colts' three-game losing streak and injected hope into their season as they prepare to host the Detroit Lions next.

Miami's offense was characterized by long, methodical drives, helping them score 30 points for the first time this season, with Tagovailoa completing 28 of 36 passes for 288 yards. Despite a resilient effort from the Raiders, who made significant coaching changes and saw Gardner Minshew throw for 282 yards with one touchdown, they couldn’t overcome their defensive errors.
