The Phoenix Suns ended their four-game losing streak with a 121-117 victory over the Chicago Bulls, highlighted by standout performances from Devin Booker, Kevin Durant, and Bradley Beal, who scored 29, 27, and 25 points, respectively.

Despite an early 10-point deficit, they rallied back, with a particularly strong second quarter performance, hitting 16 of 21 shots. Chicago managed to tie the game in the closing minutes, but Phoenix's trio secured the win. Josh Giddey led the Bulls with 24 points, while rookie Matas Buzelis contributed 15. The Bulls, struggling with consistent scoring, particularly after the first quarter, committed 21 personal fouls compared to Phoenix's 11. The game marked the Suns' first win with Booker, Durant, and Beal all in the lineup since January 31, while the Bulls succumbed to their sixth consecutive loss.

In a thrilling finish, the Brooklyn Nets snatched a 105-103 victory against the Philadelphia 76ers, with Nic Claxton tipping in the decisive basket as the buzzer sounded.

The 76ers, with their star-studded lineup including Joel Embiid, Paul George, and Maxey, faltered late despite Maxey scoring 31 points.

**Denver Nuggets 100 - 123 Los Angeles Lakers**  
Luka Doncic had a breakout performance for the Los Angeles Lakers, scoring 32 points in a commanding 123-100 victory over the Denver Nuggets, ending Denver's nine-game winning streak. The win marked the Lakers' first victory in Denver since April 2022. LeBron James contributed 25 points, Austin Reaves added 23, and Rui Hachimura had 21 before exiting due to injury; the Lakers maintained dominance with a 12-2 run after his departure. Despite Nikola Jokic posting his 26th triple-double of the season, he struggled with shooting and turnovers. This victory was notable as the Nuggets have yet to achieve a 10-game winning streak under coach Michael Malone, and none of their recent wins were against top-ranked teams. The Lakers return home for a six-game homestand and will face the Dallas Mavericks, Doncic's former team, while the Nuggets head to Indiana.

In a thrilling game, Keyonte George led the Utah Jazz to a 124-115 comeback victory over the Houston Rockets, scoring 30 points. Lauri Markkanen added a double-double with 23 points and 10 rebounds, pivotal in snapping the Jazz's two-game losing streak. Despite Alperen Sengun's strong 27-point, 12-rebound effort for Houston, the Jazz overcame a seven-point deficit in the fourth quarter thanks to a decisive 21-5 run, with Cody Williamsâ€™ layup marking a key moment. Utah's dominance in the paint, where they outscored Houston 66-36, played a significant role in the win. Walker Kessler and Isaiah Collier also contributed with solid performances, while Houston's 13-2 spurt in the second quarter briefly put them ahead. The win propels the Jazz ahead after an intense game marked by consistent scoring and strategic plays.

**Portland Trail Blazers 141 - 88 Charlotte Hornets**  
In a game filled with intriguing storylines, the Charlotte Hornets, aiming to win consecutive games in Portland for the first time since joining the league in 1988-89, are still seeking consistency under first-year coach Charles Lee. Despite snapping their 15-year road losing streak against the Trail Blazers last season, the Hornets face challenges, sitting 26 games below .500 after losing 12 of their last 15 games and navigating a tough nine-game road stretch. Miles Bridges shone with a season-best 36 points in their recent loss to the Denver Nuggets, while LaMelo Bell is expected to return after resting an ankle injury. Meanwhile, the Trail Blazers have struggled recently, losing four straight, though Deni Avdija provided a spark with a personal 9-0 run against the Lakers. Portland rookie Donovan Clingan is stepping up as a starter in place of the injured Deandre Ayton, especially showcasing his skills with a career-best 20 rebounds against the Nuggets.
