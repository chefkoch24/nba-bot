**Detroit Pistons 117 - 127 Sacramento Kings**  
In a thrilling matchup, Zach LaVine and DeMar DeRozan led the Sacramento Kings to a 127-117 victory over the Detroit Pistons with impressive performances, scoring 43 and 37 points respectively. LaVine particularly excelled with 17 of his points coming in the pivotal fourth quarter, including a late third-quarter 3-pointer that gave Sacramento their first lead since early in the game. Domantas Sabonis also delivered a standout performance with a triple-double of 19 points, 15 rebounds, and 10 assists. Although the Pistons managed an early 29-10 run in the second quarter to lead 66-48, they couldn't hold off the Kings' relentless offense. Sacramento shot 51.6% from the field and hit 40.7% of their 3-pointers, while Detroit, despite Cade Cunningham's 35 points, succumbed to their fourth loss in five games. Sacramento's Malik Monk left the game early due to a calf injury, and they were missing key players Keegan Murray and Jake LaRavia. The Pistons fell short of setting a new franchise record for 3-pointers made in a season, managing 13-of-39 against the Kings. Sacramento, gaining momentum with a three-game winning streak, prepares for a homestand against Denver, while Detroit will face New York next.

**Miami Heat 117 - 105 Philadelphia 76ers**  
The Miami Heat pulled away late to secure a 117-105 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers, with Duncan Robinson's impressive 12-point surge in the fourth quarter contributing to his 21-point total. Tyler Herro added 20 points, while Kelâ€™el Ware had a standout performance with 19 points and 17 rebounds. Despite strong efforts from Quentin Grimes and Lonnie Walker IV, who each scored 29 points for Philadelphia, the 76ers suffered their 12th consecutive loss. The Heat, missing key players like Bam Adebayo, Kevin Love, and Andrew Wiggins, capitalized on a late 16-3 run to seal the win. This victory places Miami just a half-game behind Chicago in the tight race for playoff spots in the Eastern Conference. The 76ers' season has been plagued by injuries and was described by coach Nick Nurse as a significant disappointment. The Heat's upcoming game against Chicago holds crucial play-in tournament implications.
