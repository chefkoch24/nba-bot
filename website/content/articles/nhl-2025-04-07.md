**Minnesota Wild 3 - 2 Dallas Stars**  
In a thrilling showdown at Xcel Energy Center, the Minnesota Wild secured a 3-2 overtime victory against the Dallas Stars, thanks to a power-play goal by Marco Rossi just 58 seconds into overtime. Rossi's decisive goal, assisted by Mats Zuccarello's shot during a 4-on-3 advantage, helped the Wild close in on a playoff position, moving within two points of the St. Louis Blues for the first wild card in the Western Conference. Minnesota, which had been on a four-game losing streak, was buoyed by strong performances from Matt Boldy, who had a goal and two assists, and Marcus Foligno, who also found the net. Despite Dallas's Jason Robertson and Thomas Harley scoring goals, and a strong 38-save effort from Jake Oettinger, the Stars, already secured a playoff spot, could not withstand Minnesota's 17-4 shot advantage in the third period. The win highlighted a return to form for the Wild as they aim for consistency and fighting spirit in their playoff pursuit.

**Ottawa Senators 4 - 0 Columbus Blue Jackets**  
Ullmark, Senators shut out Blue Jackets, gain in Atlantic
 **OTTAWA** \-\- <forge-entity title="Linus Ullmark" slug="linus-ullmark-8476999" code="player">Linus Ullmark</forge-entity> made 29 saves for the Ottawa Senators in their second straight shutout win, 4-0 against the Columbus Blue Jackets at Canadian Tire Centre on Sunday. 
“We’ve stressed it a lot from the beginning, you don’t have games or stretches like this without your goalies playing well,” Ottawa coach Travis Green said.

It was Ullmark's fourth shutout of the season for the Senators (42-29-6), who lead the NHL with 10. <forge-entity title="Anton Forsberg" slug="anton-forsberg-8476341" code="player">Anton Forsberg</forge-entity> made 40 saves in a 3-0 victory against the Florida Panthers on Saturday.

“Lately, we haven’t done as many immature mistakes,” Ullmark said of the team’s defensive play. “We don’t force plays as much as we did earlier in the season. You know, we take what’s there, and if there’s no play, we chip it out, live to fight another day.” 
<forge-entity title="Nikolas Matinpalo" slug="nikolas-matinpalo-8484321" code="player">Nikolas Matinpalo</forge-entity> scored his first NHL goal and <forge-entity title="Thomas Chabot" slug="thomas-chabot-8478469" code="player">Thomas Chabot</forge-entity> had two assists for the Senators, who have won three straight and moved within two points of the Florida Panthers for third in the Atlantic Division.

Ottawa is also five points ahead of the Montreal Canadiens for the first wild card in the Eastern Conference.

“I thought we played a pretty complete game,” Green said. “I loved our start, loved how we came out and kind of set the game how we wanted to play, to be honest. Really liked our third period, spent a lot of good time in their zone and played a really good, complete game. And Linus was good in net.”

<forge-entity title="Elvis Merzlikins" slug="elvis-merzlikins-8478007" code="player">Elvis Merzlikins</forge-entity> made 22 saves in relief for the Blue Jackets (34-33-9), who were shut out for the second straight game following a 5-0 loss to the Toronto Maple Leafs on Saturday. <forge-entity title="Daniil Tarasov" slug="daniil-tarasov-8476549" code="player">Daniil Tarasov</forge-entity> was pulled early in the first period after allowing two goals on six shots.

“You’ve got to be patient, as I’ve said from the start of the season,” Merzlikins said. “We’re not a bad hockey team. I believe in my boys. I know they are trying and they are working their \[behinds\] off, and sooner or later it’s going to come. I know it didn’t \[come\], I know they’re frustrated, I see that. It’s just about patience. It’s a team sport. You cannot be an individual. This is the NHL.”

Columbus, which has lost three straight, is eight points behind the Canadiens for the second wild card.

“Clearly, we’re not scoring goals,” Blue Jackets coach Dean Evason said. “So, it just gets magnified when you get down because you’re pressing even harder, and when you’re not having success and you’re not scoring goals and you’re pressing, it’s not a good recipe.” 
Ottawa went in front 1-0 at 2:24 of the first period when <forge-entity title="Adam Gaudette" slug="adam-gaudette-8478874" code="player">Adam Gaudette</forge-entity> beat Tarasov blocker side with a wrist shot from the top of the slot on the rush. It was Gaudette’s first goal in 24 games.

“I don’t think it’s ‘Tary’s’ fault, obviously,” Columbus defenseman <forge-entity title="Ivan Provorov" slug="ivan-provorov-8478500" code="player">Ivan Provorov</forge-entity> said of Tarasov being pulled. “I think the whole team, as a team, we didn’t start on time once again on a back-to-back. Honestly, I don’t really know what our problem is with back-to-backs, but this has been our weakest spot so far of the season.” 
Matinpalo tipped <forge-entity title="Claude Giroux" slug="claude-giroux-8473512" code="player">Claude Giroux</forge-entity>’s shot from the point and then scored on his own rebound at the edge of the crease to make it 2-0 at 4:26.

“I was alone in front of the net, I don’t know why,” Matinpalo laughed. “\[The puck was\] just bouncing and I just put it in.”

Perron pushed the lead to 3-0 at 4:32 of the third period. While crashing the net, Perron juggled a <forge-entity title="Drake Batherson" slug="drake-batherson-8480208" code="player">Drake Batherson</forge-entity> rebound with his right skate before batting it in.

<forge-entity title="Shane Pinto" slug="shane-pinto-8481596" code="player">Shane Pinto</forge-entity> scored into the empty net for the 4-0 final at 19:19.

**Detroit Red Wings 2 - 1 Florida Panthers**  
The Detroit Red Wings edged out the Florida Panthers with a 2-1 victory at Little Caesars Arena, thanks to Cam Talbot's exceptional 32-save performance. Key goals from Alex DeBrincat, including a power-play goal, and J.T. Compher secured Detroit's third win in their last four games, keeping them in contention for a wild card spot in the Stanley Cup Playoffs. Despite missing key players like Aleksander Barkov and Matthew Tkachuk, the Panthers remained resilient, with Anton Lundell netting a late goal, though they ultimately suffered their fifth consecutive loss. Talbot's crucial saves, particularly in the dying moments, preserved the narrow win. Florida's newest acquisition, Jesse Puljujarvi, made his debut, contributing five shots on goal, while Patrick Kane notched another assist for Detroit. As the Red Wings set their sights on a pivotal clash against Montreal, the Panthers, still in third place in the Atlantic Division, aim to regroup with their star players resting for the postseason.

**Buffalo Sabres 6 - 3 Boston Bruins**  
In a thrilling match at KeyBank Center, Tage Thompson's hat trick led the Buffalo Sabres to a 6-3 victory over the Boston Bruins. The Sabres, improving to a four-game winning streak, also saw contributions from Rasmus Dahlin and Alex Tuch, who each added a goal and an assist. Despite the Bruins' efforts, highlighted by David Pastrnak's trio of assists, they continued their slump, going 1-10-1 in their last 12 games. Notably, Pastrnak's current performance ties him with Sam Gagner for an NHL record, having factored in 11 consecutive team goals. The Bruins initially held the lead, but momentum shifted as Buffalo capitalized on opportunities, overcoming a slow start with strategic plays. Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen provided crucial saves, while the Sabres' defensemen, including Peyton Krebs, reached significant seasonal milestones.

**Chicago Blackhawks 3 - 1 Pittsburgh Penguins**  
In a decisive victory, Ilya Mikheyev's two-goal performance propelled the Chicago Blackhawks to a 3-1 win against the Pittsburgh Penguins, ending a five-game losing streak. Frank Nazar also contributed with a short-handed goal, and Spencer Knight made 28 saves for the Blackhawks at the United Center. The Penguins, playing on the second night of a back-to-back after a win over the Dallas Stars, fell behind despite Rickard Rakell’s power-play goal and 28 saves from Alex Nedeljkovic. Rakell's goal, his 34th of the season, matched his career high set in 2017-18. The Blackhawks' win featured a notable first NHL point for rookie Sam Rinzel with an assist, and though Sidney Crosby saw his 12-game point streak end, Mikheyev sealed the game with an empty-netter. Penguins coach Mike Sullivan remarked on his team’s lack of energy compared to the previous night's performance, contributing to their elimination from playoff contention.

**Nashville Predators 1 - 2 Montreal Canadiens**  
In an exciting showdown at Bridgestone Arena, Jakub Dobes' 36 save performance powered the Montreal Canadiens to a 2-1 victory over the Nashville Predators, marking their fifth consecutive win. Cole Caufield and Patrik Laine each scored for the Canadiens, who are now within five points of the Eastern Conference wild card playoff spot, with just five games left in the season. Despite an early goal by Steven Stamkos, and a formidable effort from a determined Predators squad, Nashville's six-game losing streak persisted as a potential goal was annulled due to goaltender interference. For Nashville, the game was notable for the NHL debut of Matthew Wood, their 2023 draft pick, who capably managed a shot on goal in 13 minutes of ice time. Canadiens’ forward Nick Suzuki also continued his impressive form, extending his point streak to five games.

**Vancouver Canucks 2 - 3 Vegas Golden Knights**  
In an exciting hockey showdown, Victor Olofsson scored the decisive goal at 16:46 of the third period, leading the Vegas Golden Knights to a 3-2 victory over the Vancouver Canucks at Rogers Arena. William Karlsson orchestrated the crucial play by maneuvering wide around Quinn Hughes and delivering a precise backhand pass to Olofsson, who was left unmarked in the low slot, allowing him to swiftly shoot past Canucks' goalie Kevin Lankinen. The win, bolstered by additional goals from Ivan Barbashev and Nicolas Roy and 19 saves by Adin Hill, enabled the Golden Knights to extend their lead over the Los Angeles Kings for the top spot in the Pacific Division. In contrast, Vancouver, who saw goals from Nils Hoglander and Aatu Raty and a commendable 32-save performance by Lankinen, struggled to close the gap to playoff contention, sitting eight points shy of the Minnesota Wild for the Western Conference's second wild card. Notably, Hoglander returned from a six-game absence due to injury, scoring the opening goal to momentarily put the Canucks ahead.
