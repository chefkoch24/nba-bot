**Miami Heat 91 - 103 Boston Celtics**  
The Boston Celtics secured a playoff spot by defeating the Miami Heat 103-91, pulling away in the fourth quarter with the help of Jayson Tatum's 28 points and Jrue Holiday's 25. Derrick White contributed 18 points, and the Celtics shot impressively from beyond the arc with 19 successful 3-pointers.

Notably absent for Boston were Jaylen Brown and Kristaps Porzingis, both sitting out due to injuries and illness. The Celtics' strategic play saw them launch a decisive 10-0 run early in the fourth, demonstrating their prowess by achieving four 3-pointers in just over two minutes. Meanwhile, Miami experimented with a new starting lineup that had not previously played together. Both teams are set for a quick turnaround with games scheduled the following night.
