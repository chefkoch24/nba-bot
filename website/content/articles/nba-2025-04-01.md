**Charlotte Hornets 110 - 106 Utah Jazz**  
The Charlotte Hornets snapped a five-game losing streak by edging out the Utah Jazz 110-106, with standout performances from Miles Bridges, who posted 26 points, 10 rebounds, and eight assists, and Mark Williams, contributing 18 points and 13 rebounds. The Hornets took a substantial lead in the first half by making 11 of 22 three-pointers, though the Jazz rallied back, tying the game late in the third via a three-pointer by Keyonte George, who scored 20 points. Despite multiple chances to lead, the Jazz, who now hold the league's worst record at 16-60, couldn't seal the comeback. Former Duke player Kyle Filipowski struggled initially in his return to North Carolina, missing his first eight shots before finishing with 14 points and 13 rebounds. Notably, Bridges ended his shooting slump by making 3 of 6 from beyond the arc. In the final moments, Josh Green ensured the Hornets' victory with crucial free throws after Filipowski and George missed vital shots for the Jazz. Both teams are slated for road games this Wednesday.

**Indiana Pacers 111 - 109 Sacramento Kings**  
In a thrilling game at Indianapolis, the Indiana Pacers overcame a 16-point deficit in the second half to edge out the Sacramento Kings 111-109. Aaron Nesmith was pivotal, scoring 17 of his 24 points in the latter half, while Obi Toppin contributed 19 points. Tyrese Haliburton, facing his former team, dropped 18 points and 11 assists, including a crucial go-ahead three-pointer with just over a minute to play. DeMar DeRozan led the Kings with 31 points and eight assists, while Domantas Sabonis, a former Pacer, added 25 points and 16 rebounds. Despite Sacramento's earlier dominance with a 76-60 lead in the third quarter, they failed to secure a win that could have improved their standing in the Western Conference play-in tournament. The Pacers have now won seven of their last nine games and look forward to upcoming home matches against less challenging opponents.

**Orlando Magic 87 - 96 LA Clippers**  
In a game where defense took center stage, the Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Orlando Magic 96-87 in Orlando. Kawhi Leonard and Norman Powell each contributed 21 points, while Ivica Zubac dominated the boards with an impressive 18 points and 20 rebounds, helping the Clippers secure their 11th win in 14 games.

For the Magic, Paolo Banchero scored 26 points but struggled with his shooting, going 8 for 24 and committing six turnovers. Franz Wagner added 21 points, but Orlando's cold 39% shooting led to their eighth loss in their last 10 home games. The Magic, now trailing Atlanta in the Eastern Conference play-in race, have struggled against the top Western teams, with their only two wins coming against the Lakers. The Clippers took advantage of Orlando's missteps, maintaining at least a five-point lead through the game's closing stages.

**Washington Wizards 94 - 120 Miami Heat**  
The Miami Heat dominated the Washington Wizards 120-94, marking their fifth consecutive victory, an impressive rebound from an earlier losing streak of at least 10 games. This achievement places the Heat among only three teams in NBA history to follow such a slump with a winning streak of at least five games, sharing this distinction with the 2021-22 Houston Rockets and the 2017-18 Chicago Bulls. Miami's Bam Adebayo starred with 28 points and 12 rebounds, while Tyler Herro contributed 27 points. The Heat's winning streak has seen them win each of their last five games by at least 10 points. Despite a strong performance from Jordan Poole, who scored 35 points and set a new franchise record for three-pointers in a season, the Wizards suffered their 49th double-digit loss of the season. The Miami Heat will continue their road trip against Boston, while Washington will face Sacramento next.

**Memphis Grizzlies 103 - 117 Boston Celtics**  
The Boston Celtics made history by sweeping a six-game road trip for the first time, finishing with a 117-103 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies. Key performances included Jayson Tatum's 25 points and 14 rebounds, Al Horford's 26 points, and Kristaps Porzingis adding 19. This success equaled the franchise record for 32 road wins in a season and extended the Celtics' winning streak to nine games as they ended March with a 13-1 record. Despite a strong effort from Ja Morant and the Grizzlies, who came within seven points late in the game, Memphis fell short due in part to missing their last six 3-pointers of the first half, resulting in their sixth loss in seven games. Notably, the game continued with only two officials in the second half due to an injury to referee Matt Kallio. This win solidified Boston's position in second place in the Eastern Conference, while Memphis nears the play-in zone under interim coach Tuomas Iisalo.

Oklahoma City boasts a stellar 28-1 record against Eastern Conference teams this season, including undefeated at home. Despite Jevon Carter's 17-point effort with five 3-pointers for the Bulls, Chicago fell behind Miami for the last play-in spot in the Eastern Conference. During an explosive second quarter, the Thunder turned a close game into a 65-33 lead, scoring 85 points in the second and third quarters combined.

Meanwhile, the Lakers, aiming to secure a top-six playoff spot and fresh from a 134-127 win against the Memphis Grizzlies, see Austin Reaves in top form with consecutive 30-point games.
