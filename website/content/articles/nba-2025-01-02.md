**Detroit Pistons 105 - 96 Orlando Magic**  
In a game led by the Pistons from start to finish, Detroit secured a 105-96 victory over the Orlando Magic despite a harrowing moment when Jaden Ivey suffered a serious leg injury following a collision with Cole Anthony. Prior to the injury, Ivey had scored 22 points. Tim Hardaway Jr. then stepped up, scoring nine points during a crucial stretch that helped maintain the Pistons' lead. Cade Cunningham contributed 19 points and nine assists, while Jalen Duren added a double-double with 18 points and 11 rebounds, overcoming 24 turnovers by the team. Despite a strong performance with 24 points from Jalen Suggs, Orlando couldn't overcome their deficit and has now lost six of their last nine games. Notably, the Magic roster includes several players who attended college in Michigan, although former Wolverines Franz and Moritz Wagner are currently out with injuries. Both teams look to rebound from their losses as Orlando faces Toronto and Detroit hosts Charlotte in their upcoming games.

**Washington Wizards 125 - 107 Chicago Bulls**  
Jordan Poole led the Washington Wizards with 30 points in a commanding 125-107 victory over the Chicago Bulls, marking his fifth consecutive game scoring over 25 points—a career first. Poole's performance, which included making six 3-pointers, highlighted his impressive form since joining the Wizards from Golden State. The Wizards, who are still at the bottom of the Eastern Conference, achieved their biggest win of the season with contributions from seven players scoring in double figures, including rookie Alex Sarr who added a double-double. Zach LaVine returned for the Bulls with 32 points, but Chicago struggled with 20 turnovers and poor 3-point shooting at 29.8%, trailing for the final three quarters. Washington secured the game with a decisive 7-0 run early in the fourth quarter, extending their lead to 20 points. Despite the win, the Wizards remain at 6-25, while Chicago, now 15-19, faces a critical home stretch in seven of their next eight games.

**Miami Heat 119 - 108 New Orleans Pelicans**  
In a thrilling game, Tyler Herro led the Miami Heat to a 119-108 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans by scoring 32 points. Bam Adebayo nearly achieved a triple-double with 23 points, nine rebounds, and 10 assists, while Duncan Robinson added 17 points for Miami. The game was overshadowed by a tragic incident in New Orleans, where a truck attacked New Year's revelers, resulting in at least 15 deaths, a situation President Biden called "despicable." Trey Murphy III was a standout for the struggling Pelicans, scoring 34 points, marking their 29th loss in the last 32 games and their 15th consecutive road loss, a mark hit only 100 times in NBA history. Notably, Herro's awkward alley-oop attempt turned into a surprising three-pointer, sparking a hot streak of five consecutive three-pointers. Jimmy Butler returned from a five-game hiatus, contributing nine points. The Heat will face Indiana next, while the Pelicans take on Washington.

**New York Knicks 119 - 103 Utah Jazz**  
The New York Knicks secured their ninth consecutive victory by defeating the Utah Jazz 119-103, despite missing their leading scorer Jalen Brunson due to a calf injury. Karl-Anthony Towns led with 31 points and 21 rebounds, while Josh Hart recorded his second consecutive triple-double with 15 points, 14 rebounds, and 12 assists, becoming the first Knicks player since Michael Ray Richardson in 1981 to achieve this feat in back-to-back games. This victory saw Hart notch his fourth triple-double of the season and become the fourth player in Knicks history to achieve ten triple-doubles. Mikal Bridges contributed 27 points, and OG Anunoby added 22, while Cam Payne, replacing Brunson, added eight points and nine assists. Despite strong performances from Jordan Clarkson and Collin Sexton, who each scored 25 points, the Jazz faced their fifth consecutive loss, hindered by Lauri Markkanen's shooting struggles. Rookie Tyler Kolek made a brief but notable 12-minute appearance, having played 40 minutes in a G League game earlier that day. The Knicks, demonstrating depth and resilience, shot 55% from the field and have now won 14 of their last 16 games.

**Toronto Raptors 130 - 113 Brooklyn Nets**  
The Toronto Raptors ended an 11-game losing streak with a decisive 130-113 victory over the Brooklyn Nets. Scottie Barnes led the Raptors with an impressive 33 points and 13 rebounds. Immanuel Quickley, returning for just his fourth game of the season after a significant absence due to a torn ligament in his left elbow, made a notable impact with 21 points and a season-high 15 assists. Gradey Dick and Ochai Agbaji also contributed significantly, scoring 22 and 14 points, respectively. This win marked Toronto's first triumph since early December and followed a franchise-worst 54-point loss to Boston. Despite strong performances by Cam Johnson and D'Angelo Russell, who reunited with Brooklyn following a trade, the Nets continued their struggles, losing their third straight game and 11th out of 14. The game was marred by injuries for the Nets, with Noah Clowney and Maxwell Lewis both forced to leave with ailments. The Raptors aim to build on this victory as they prepare to host Orlando, while the Nets will face Milwaukee next.

**Houston Rockets 110 - 99 Dallas Mavericks**  
In a match against the Dallas Mavericks, the Houston Rockets secured a 110-99 victory, largely due to strong performances from Alperen Sengun, who scored 23 points, and Jalen Green, with 22 points.

In the second half, the Rockets extended their lead to 72-56 early in the third quarter, maintaining a double-digit advantage throughout the game. Despite the return of key Mavericks players Kyrie Irving, Klay Thompson, and Dereck Lively II, who had been absent in their previous game, the team struggled without Luka Doncic due to a calf injury. Meanwhile, the Rockets managed effectively without Amen Thompson, who was serving a suspension. Houston capitalized on efficient free throw shooting, making 18 of 23 attempts, compared to Dallas's 8 of 16, to clinch the victory.

**Sacramento Kings 113 - 107 Philadelphia 76ers**  
In an intriguing matchup between the Philadelphia 76ers and the Sacramento Kings, the 76ers will visit Sacramento after ending 2024 on a high note, aiming to extend their four-game winning streak despite missing star player Joel Embiid due to a sprained left foot. Under second-year coach Nick Nurse, known for his Toronto Raptors legacy, the 76ers have turned their season around, winning 10 of the last 13 games. Key players like Tyrese Maxey and Paul George have excelled, while Caleb Martin's recent health resurgence has been pivotal, highlighted by his career-best performance against the Boston Celtics. Meanwhile, the Kings celebrated an emotional victory over the Dallas Mavericks, ending a six-game losing skid and marking interim coach Doug Christie's first home win, who took the helm after Mike Brown's firing. This game revisits strong bonds with the Raptors, as both head coaches have significant connections to the Toronto franchise. With historical context adding weight to this encounter, the Kings will be seeking to replicate their previous season's triumph over the 76ers without Embiid, hoping to build on the fresh momentum under Christie's leadership.
