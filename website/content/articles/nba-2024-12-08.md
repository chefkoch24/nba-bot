**Charlotte Hornets 102 - 116 Cleveland Cavaliers**  
Evan Mobley achieved a career-high 41 points, leading the Cleveland Cavaliers to a 116-102 victory over the Charlotte Hornets, marking their fourth consecutive win. Building an early 40-18 lead, the Cavs held off the Hornets' late rally, with Mobley scoring seven points in a decisive 12-2 run that secured the game. Despite Brandon Miller's 24 points, Charlotte suffered its eighth straight defeat, hindered by the absence of key players like LaMelo Ball and Miles Bridges due to injuries. Cleveland's strong performance continues their best start since the 2008-09 season, as they maintain an NBA-leading scoring average of 121.8 points per game.

**Washington Wizards 122 - 113 Denver Nuggets**  
In a surprising turn of events, the Washington Wizards ended their 16-game losing streak with a 122-113 victory over the Denver Nuggets, despite Nikola Jokić's career-high 56 points. Washington, led by Jordan Poole's 39 points and a career-best nine 3-pointers, managed to stave off Jokić's solo effort as Denver was missing key players like Jamal Murray, Aaron Gordon, and Dario Saric due to injuries. Jokić set another personal record with 38 field goal attempts, complemented by 16 rebounds and eight assists, yet the lack of support meant Denver couldn't capitalize on his performance. Wizards also overcame their own injury absences, including Kyle Kuzma and rookie Alex Sarr, with Justin Champagnie's crucial 23 points and decisive play in the final moments. While Jokić's prior scoring record of 50 points against Sacramento was surpassed, Denver's poor 3-point shooting (5 of 24) contrasted Washington's effective 16, further ensuring the Wizards' win. Both teams are slated for back-to-back games, with Denver facing Atlanta and Washington playing Memphis.

The Pelicans, struggling with 18 turnovers and missing key player Brandon Ingram due to an ankle injury, attempted a comeback but were unable to overcome the deficit, narrowing the gap only to 114-105 in the final minutes before the Thunder pulled away. The victory marked the Thunder's seventh win in eight games, continuing their strong run with Gilgeous-Alexander achieving his 11th 30-point game of the season.

**New York Knicks 111 - 120 Detroit Pistons**  
The Detroit Pistons ended their three-game losing streak by defeating the New York Knicks 120-111, thanks in large part to Cade Cunningham’s impressive performance with 29 points, 15 assists, and 10 rebounds, marking his fifth triple-double of the season. Malik Beasley contributed 23 points off the bench, while Jaden Ivey added 16 for Detroit. For the Knicks, Jalen Brunson led with 31 points and 10 assists, and Mikal Bridges scored 20, but their efforts couldn’t prevent the end of New York’s four-game winning streak. The Knicks played without key players Karl-Anthony Towns, due to a sore knee, and Cam Payne, and lost Josh Hart in the fourth quarter to a second technical foul. Despite trailing by 17 points in the third quarter, the Knicks narrowed the gap to just two points early in the fourth, but the Pistons capitalized on turnovers and a 12-2 run to regain control. Detroit’s strong shooting was highlighted by Cunningham’s 21 first-half points, hitting 5-of-7 from long range, and the team shot 26-of-46 from the field in the first half.

**Toronto Raptors 118 - 125 Dallas Mavericks**  
Luka Doncic recorded his second consecutive triple-double, leading the Dallas Mavericks to a 125-118 victory over the Toronto Raptors and extending their winning streak to seven games. With 30 points, 13 rebounds, and 11 assists, Doncic surpassed Wilt Chamberlain and James Harden to secure the seventh spot on the all-time triple-double list with 79 career triple-doubles. Kyrie Irving contributed significantly, scoring 29 points, including 14 of the Mavericks' final 17 points in the first quarter. The Mavericks dominated early, with a spectacular 35-foot buzzer-beater from Doncic giving them a 70-54 halftime lead. Despite Toronto's late rally, which cut the deficit to five points, controversial calls thwarted their comeback attempt. Gradey Dick led the Raptors with 27 points, and Jakob Poeltl returned to action with 20 points. Dallas now prepares for a challenging matchup against Western Conference-leading Oklahoma City.

**Boston Celtics 121 - 127 Memphis Grizzlies**  
Ja Morant's near triple-double performance of 32 points, nine assists, and nine rebounds led the Memphis Grizzlies to a 127-121 victory over the Boston Celtics, ending a 10-game losing streak at TD Garden dating back to 2013. Alongside Morant, Jaren Jackson Jr. contributed significantly with 27 points and nine rebounds, helping Memphis secure their first win in Boston in nearly a decade and marking their eighth win in the last nine games. Despite a strong comeback by the Celtics in the fourth quarter, where they erased a 14-point third-quarter deficit, Memphis pulled ahead with crucial baskets down the stretch. This game also marked Marcus Smart's return to Boston for the first time since being traded to the Grizzlies, receiving a warm ovation from the fans despite struggling with his shot. The Celtics, led by Jrue Holiday's 23 points and supported by Jaylen Brown and Payton Pritchard's 22 points each, struggled from beyond the arc, shooting 18 for 60, and lost for the first time this season on the second night of a back-to-back. Memphis dominated in the paint, outscoring Boston 64-40, and will face the Washington Wizards next, while the Celtics prepare to host the Detroit Pistons.

The Miami Heat secured a win over the Phoenix Suns with a 121-111 victory, thanks to standout performances by Bam Adebayo, who scored 25 points alongside 12 rebounds and eight assists, and Jimmy Butler, who added 24 points. The Heat, now 11-10, outpaced the Suns 68-53 in the second half as Duncan Robinson and Tyler Herro contributed significantly to Miami's offense. Phoenix struggled without key players Kevin Durant and Jusuf Nurkic, with Durant's absence particularly impactful as they remain winless in the last seven games without him, highlighting a concerning trend of 0-8 when allowing opponents to score 120 points. Miami excelled in the paint, outscoring the Suns 62-32, and showed defensive strength by maintaining a strong record when limiting teams to under 115 points.
