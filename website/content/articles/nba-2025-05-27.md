**Minnesota Timberwolves 126 - 128 Oklahoma City Thunder**  
The Oklahoma City Thunder secured a 128-126 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves in Game 4 of the Western Conference finals, taking a commanding 3-1 series lead. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander delivered an MVP-caliber performance with 40 points, 10 rebounds, and nine assists, bouncing back from a prior 42-point loss. Jalen Williams added 34 points, shining with six 3-pointers, while Chet Holmgren impressed in his hometown with 21 points, seven rebounds, and three blocks. The Thunder's defense, spearheaded by Luguentz Dort, limited key players Anthony Edwards and Julius Randle, with Edwards scoring just 16 points. Despite strong bench contributions from Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Donte DiVincenzo, the Timberwolves couldn't overcome OKC, who never trailed beyond the first quarter. The Thunder's improved 3-point shooting and strategic plays, like fouling Edwards in the final seconds, kept them ahead. With their home dominance this postseason, the Thunder now head back to Oklahoma City for Game 5, poised to advance to the NBA Finals.
