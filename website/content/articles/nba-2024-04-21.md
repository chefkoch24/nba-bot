The New York Knicks defeated the Philadelphia 76ers 111-104 in Game 1 of their Eastern Conference first-round series, with backups Deuce McBride and Bojan Bogdanovic playing key roles in the victory. Jalen Brunson and Josh Hart each scored 22 points for the Knicks, while McBride's 21-point performance off the bench was crucial, especially in the second quarter after Joel Embiid left the game briefly due to injury.
