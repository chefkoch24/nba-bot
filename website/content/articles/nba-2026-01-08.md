**Charlotte Hornets 96 - 97 Toronto Raptors**  
Immanuel Quickley's buzzer-beating 3-pointer lifted the Toronto Raptors to a dramatic 97-96 victory over the Charlotte Hornets, overcoming a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter. RJ Barrett led the Raptors with 28 points and seven rebounds, while Quickley contributed 21 points, including his crucial shot that silenced the home crowd. The game marked Toronto's fifth win in six games, with Scottie Barnes adding 17 points. Despite Collin Sexton's 22 points and LaMelo Ball's late layup giving Charlotte a brief lead, the Hornets fell short after committing 18 turnovers compared to Toronto's six. The Raptors made a strong comeback, shooting 4 of 7 from beyond the arc in the final quarter, in stark contrast to their 3 of 27 performance in the first three quarters. The loss prevented Charlotte from capitalizing on their prior upset win over the Oklahoma City Thunder, despite a promising start and a double-digit lead early in the fourth.

**Detroit Pistons 108 - 93 Chicago Bulls**  
Isaiah Stewart set a career high with 31 points, leading the injury-hit Detroit Pistons to a 108-93 victory over the Chicago Bulls. This marked Detroit's fourth win in five games, achieved despite the absence of key players like All-Star Cade Cunningham, Tobias Harris, and Jalen Duren. Stewart was instrumental, contributing 11 points in the first quarter alone. Daniss Jenkins, a two-way player, also stood out by recording a personal best of 15 assists along with six rebounds. While Ayo Dosunmu scored 24 points for the Bulls, who have now lost three consecutive games, Nikola Vucevic and Matas Buzelis added 20 points each. Chicago led 77-76 at the end of the third quarter but faltered in the fourth, managing only 10 points while missing numerous attempts and committing turnovers. This allowed Detroit to dominate, particularly with a 14-4 advantage in points in the paint, thereby sealing the win. The Bulls will face Miami next, while the Pistons are set to host the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.

In a commanding performance, Joel Embiid scored 28 points to lead the Philadelphia 76ers to a 131-110 victory over the Washington Wizards, with all of Philadelphia's starters, including Paul George and Tyrese Maxey, scoring in double figures. Embiid's early 16-point surge set the tone, and an 11-0 run at the start of the fourth quarter, highlighted by a Quentin Grimes dunk, solidified their lead. The 76ers, rebounding from a narrow loss to Denver, had their full lineup for the first time this season, welcoming back Kelly Oubre Jr. and Trendon Watford from injuries. Meanwhile, the Wizards, dealing with injuries to key players like Khris Middleton and recently acquired CJ McCollum, were also missing Corey Kispert and Keyshawn George. In a major development, the Associated Press reported a trade sending Trae Young to Washington and McCollum to Atlanta. Despite the shuffle, Tre Johnson led the Wizards with 20 points.

Despite the absence of Trae Young, who's expected to join the Washington Wizards in a trade involving CJ McCollum and Corey Kispert, the Hawks ended a two-game losing streak. On the other hand, the Pelicans, who were led by Zion Williamson's 22 points, stumbled to their ninth consecutive loss. The Hawks established a commanding 89-66 lead by the end of the third quarter and maintained the advantage, while the Pelicans struggled from beyond the arc.

**Boston Celtics 110 - 114 Denver Nuggets**  
In a thrilling matchup missing key players Nikola Jokic and Jayson Tatum, Jamal Murray's 22 points and 17 assists propelled the Denver Nuggets to a nail-biting 114-110 victory over the Boston Celtics. Despite 26 lead changes and nine ties, Denver turned a three-point deficit in the fourth quarter into a commanding 101-90 lead with a 14-0 run. Peyton Watson contributed 30 points, while Zeke Nnaji scored eight during the decisive run. Boston's Jaylen Brown put up 33 points, and Neemias Queta achieved a career-high 20 rebounds, but their efforts fell short as Denver snapped Boston's five-game winning streak. The Nuggets, struggling with six losses in their previous ten games, showed resilience, especially with key players like Murray returning to the lineup after missing the previous game.

Paolo Banchero's heroic 3-pointer at the overtime buzzer secured the Orlando Magic's thrilling 104-103 win over the Brooklyn Nets, continuing Orlando's winning streak against Brooklyn to eight games. Banchero led the Magic with a stellar performance, scoring 30 points, aided by Wendell Carter Jr.'s 20 points and Tristan da Silva's 14. The intense overtime saw Egor Demin briefly give the Nets a lead with a 3-pointer, before Carter dunked to put the Magic back ahead. Demin's subsequent 3-pointer seemed to secure the game for Brooklyn, but Banchero's 26-foot bank shot clinched the victory. Michael Porter Jr. was the standout for the Nets with 34 points, supported by Demin's 18. This game marked a tight contest, as both teams went back and forth with lead changes, especially in the crucial final seconds of regulation and overtime.

**New York Knicks 123 - 111 LA Clippers**  
In a compelling matchup, the New York Knicks ended their four-game losing streak with a 123-111 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers. Karl-Anthony Towns was instrumental for the Knicks, bouncing back from a lackluster performance in their previous game with 20 points, 11 rebounds, and a season-high seven assists. He notably contributed 10 points in the decisive fourth quarter, helping the Knicks execute a dominant 24-7 run bridging the third and fourth quarters that turned a close game in their favor. Jalen Brunson led the Knicks with 26 points, while OG Anunoby and Deuce McBride added 20 and 16 points, respectively. Despite a strong start and a standout 25-point effort by Kawhi Leonard, the Clippers could not keep up, losing for just the second time in their last nine games. James Harden added 23 points and nine assists for the Clippers, showing resilience after missing the previous game due to shoulder soreness. Ivica Zubac and John Collins also contributed with impressive performances but couldn't prevent the Knicks from pulling away in the final quarter. Both teams are set to hit the road on Friday, with the Clippers visiting Brooklyn and the Knicks starting a four-game road trip in Phoenix.

**San Antonio Spurs 107 - 91 Los Angeles Lakers**  
In a tightly contested game mid-season, the San Antonio Spurs fell 106-105 to Memphis despite leading by 11 points early in the third quarter. The game marked Victor Wembanyama's return from a two-game injury absence, where he impressively scored 30 points in just 21 minutes off the bench, though his efforts couldn't secure the win. Spurs coach Mitch Johnson voiced frustration over the team's execution and focus, while De'Aaron Fox's late-game efforts were not enough to prevent the loss. Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Lakers prepare to face the Spurs after a 111-103 victory over New Orleans, fueled by 30-point performances from both Luka Doncic and LeBron James. The Lakers demonstrated depth, claiming their third straight win despite missing key starters, by capitalizing on strong performances from their supporting cast, including Deandre Ayton's 18 points and 11 rebounds. This setup a compelling showdown between the Lakers and Spurs, with Wembanyama's participation still uncertain due to his knee soreness.

**Memphis Grizzlies 98 - 117 Phoenix Suns**  
The Phoenix Suns dominated the Memphis Grizzlies with a 117-98 victory, bolstered by strong performances from Dillon Brooks and Grayson Allen, both former Grizzlies players who scored 21 and 19 points respectively. Brooks impressively netted 18 points in the first half, helping the Suns establish an early lead. Despite Memphis's efforts, their 18 turnovers were costly, allowing Phoenix to capitalize and score 25 points off those errors. Devin Booker contributed 13 points for the Suns, who have now won seven of their last nine games. The Grizzlies, hindered by injury-related absences, including key player Ja Morant, managed to shoot only 42% from the field. Jaren Jackson Jr. led Memphis with 19 points, but without their full roster, they struggled to overcome Phoenix's substantial lead, ultimately falling short despite a recent narrow victory over the San Antonio Spurs.

**Oklahoma City Thunder 129 - 125 Utah Jazz**  
Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Oklahoma City Thunder with a stellar performance, scoring 46 points, including a crucial shot at the regulation buzzer, to secure a 129-125 overtime victory against the Utah Jazz and snap a two-game losing streak. He continued his impressive streak of scoring at least 20 points in 109 consecutive games, the second-longest in NBA history. Chet Holmgren contributed significantly with 23 points and 12 rebounds, while Jalen Williams and Ajay Mitchell added 17 and 16 points, respectively, for the defending champion Thunder. Oklahoma City had a rocky recent run, losing six of their last 12 games, including a disappointing loss to Charlotte. For Utah, Lauri Markkanen scored 29 points with 13 rebounds, and Keyonte George and Jusuf Nurkic made important contributions, but their efforts couldn't prevent a fifth consecutive loss. The Thunder initially led by 20 but faced a strong comeback from the Jazz, who briefly took the lead before Gilgeous-Alexander's key plays clinched the win.

**Golden State Warriors 120 - 113 Milwaukee Bucks**  
The Golden State Warriors are set to host the Milwaukee Bucks, fresh off Giannis Antetokounmpo's impressive 37-point, 11-rebound performance against the Sacramento Kings. The Bucks have been thriving, winning four of their last five games, with standout contributions from guards Kevin Porter Jr. and Ryan Rollins. Rollins, who once played briefly for the Warriors, shone with 32 points against them in an October game, overshadowing Stephen Curry's 27. He's been promoted as a top candidate for the league's Most Improved Player award, earning praise from teammate Porter Jr. Meanwhile, the Warriors are navigating a challenging schedule amid injuries and coaching changes; they recently suffered a 103-102 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers, where Curry fouled out and coach Steve Kerr was ejected, leaving Terry Stotts to draw up the final, unsuccessful play. Despite the defeat, Draymond Green highlighted positives in the defensive effort and ball-handling.

**Portland Trail Blazers 103 - 102 Houston Rockets**  
Deni Avdija led the Portland Trail Blazers to victory with 41 points against the Houston Rockets, marking a continuation of strong performances as he's averaged 32 points, 10 assists, and 8.3 rebounds over the last three games. The game featured two teams on hot streaks, with both training for a double-header. Kevin Durant's recent arrival in Houston and his thriving performance after a tense departure from Phoenix add intrigue. Durant's 26 points against his former team underscored his competitive spirit, especially given his pursuit of Wilt Chamberlain on the all-time scoring list. Despite his impressive showing, Alperen Sengun's absence due to injury left the Rockets vulnerable. Meanwhile, the Trail Blazers thrived with contributions from Shaedon Sharpe and are anticipating the return of key players Jrue Holiday and Jerami Grant. Portland's decisive execution and communication were pivotal, reflected in their recent commanding victory over the Utah Jazz.
