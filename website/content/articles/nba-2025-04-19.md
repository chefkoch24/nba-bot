**Atlanta Hawks 114 - 123 Miami Heat**  
The Miami Heat clinched the No. 8 seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs after defeating the Atlanta Hawks in an overtime thriller. This win enables them to face the top-seeded Cleveland Cavaliers in the first round. Despite losing the regular-season series to the Hawks, who had a better record, the Heat prevailed in this crucial play-in matchup. The Heat's Tyler Herro was instrumental, scoring 38 points against the Chicago Bulls in a previous elimination game, maintaining his strong form from the regular season. Herro's performances have been pivotal, having scored 20 or more points in his last ten regular-season games. Conversely, Atlanta's star guard Trae Young had a mixed experience, rebounding from a challenging game against Orlando where he was limited to one 3-pointer and ejected, yet finished with 28 points. The Hawks had missed the chance to secure a playoff spot earlier when they were heavily defeated by the Magic. With this victory, the Southeast Division is guaranteed two playoff spots, equaling the number from the Atlantic Division.
