**Sacramento Kings 99 - 103 Los Angeles Lakers**  
LeBron James powered the Los Angeles Lakers to a 103-99 victory over the Sacramento Kings, clinching a two-game sweep on Saturday.

De'Aaron Fox led the Kings with 31 points, supported by Domantas Sabonis' 19 points and 19 rebounds. The game was marked by early turnovers, as the Lakers significantly reduced mistakes after an error-prone first quarter, in contrast to the Kings, who struggled with ball control from the start. Both teams shot poorly from beyond the arc, with Sacramento's 27% narrowly outperforming Los Angeles' 25.7%.

**Cleveland Cavaliers 126 - 99 Philadelphia 76ers**  
The Cleveland Cavaliers dominated the Philadelphia 76ers with a 126-99 victory, led by Darius Garland's 26 points and Evan Mobley's impressive performance of 22 points, 13 rebounds, and seven assists.

Tyrese Maxey shone for the 76ers with 27 points, 13 of which came in the third quarter, but Philadelphia struggled without key player Joel Embiid, who sat out due to injury. Mobley's explosive play in the paint, including a notable slam dunk over KJ Martin and Andre Drummond, sparked a significant run for the Cavaliers, highlighting a career-high season for the fourth-year pro. The game marked a historical moment for Cleveland as they hit 19 or more three-pointers in three consecutive games for the first time in franchise history.

**Chicago Bulls 98 - 123 Boston Celtics**  
Jayson Tatum delivered an electrifying performance with a season-high 43 points, 16 rebounds, and 10 assists, securing his third career triple-double as the Boston Celtics defeated the Chicago Bulls 123-98. Kristaps Porzingis and Jaylen Brown contributed 22 and 19 points, respectively, helping the Celtics to rebound after a recent loss to the Bulls. Tatum shone in the third quarter, leading a 19-8 run that stretched Boston's lead to 93-77. Despite Nikola Vucevic’s solid effort with 19 points and 10 assists, the Bulls saw their three-game winning streak come to an end, partially due to a lackluster shooting night at 37.9% accuracy. Notably, referee Aaron Smith left the game due to a hip injury, and Bulls guard Josh Giddey remained sidelined with an ankle issue. The Celtics, known for their three-point attempts, switched strategies to outperform the Bulls with 62 points in the paint and dominated the boards with 58 rebounds and 25 second-chance points.

In the Milwaukee Bucks' 112-101 victory over the Washington Wizards, Bobby Portis remarkably filled in for Giannis Antetokounmpo, who missed the game due to back spasms, by scoring a season-high 34 points along with 10 rebounds and eight assists. Khris Middleton contributed a solid 18 points, six rebounds, and eight assists, and played back-to-back games as he continues to recover from offseason ankle surgeries.

In a thrilling game on Saturday night, Stephen Curry powered the Golden State Warriors to a 113-103 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves, scoring an impressive 31 points, including 11 consecutive points in the fourth quarter.

Despite a strong effort from Anthony Edwards and Donte DiVincenzo, each with 19 points, and Rudy Gobert's double-double, the Timberwolves couldn't capitalize on their third-quarter comeback after falling into an early 21-point hole. The game marked a dramatic turnaround for the Warriors, who just two days earlier suffered a heavy defeat to the Grizzlies, and showcased their resilience as Curry's clutch shots sealed the win. The Timberwolves, who struggled with their shooting early on, made a valiant attempt to reclaim the lead but were unable to overcome the Warriors' late-game surge.

Jalen Brunson’s impressive performance led the New York Knicks to a 104-93 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans, as he scored 29 of his season-high 39 points in the second half. Despite tight defense from Herb Jones that resulted in the Knicks shooting just 35.6% in the first half, Brunson’s 16-point explosion in the third quarter sparked a crucial 22-6 run, overturning a 65-52 deficit and securing a 74-71 lead for New York. The Knicks' victory also continued New Orleans’ struggles, marking their 15th loss in 16 games. Trey Murphy III led the Pelicans with 26 points, while the Knicks also benefited from Mikal Bridges’ 18 points and OG Anunoby’s 16. Karl-Anthony Towns had limited impact due to early foul trouble, scoring only 5 points in limited minutes.

**Dallas Mavericks 113 - 97 LA Clippers**  
The Dallas Mavericks secured a 113-97 win over the Los Angeles Clippers, largely due to an impressive performance from their bench, particularly Quentin Grimes, who scored 20 points off the bench with 14 of those in a pivotal fourth quarter. Even in the absence of their leading scorer Luka Doncic, the Mavericks dominated, boasting eight players in double figures, and outscored the Clippers 31-18 in the second period. Klay Thompson, Kyrie Irving, and Spencer Dinwiddie added scores of 16 and 15 each, respectively. Notably, James Harden passed Tim Duncan to become the 16th highest scorer in NBA history. Despite the loss, Norman Powell stood out for the Clippers with 28 points and Ivica Zubac achieved his 19th double-double with 13 points and 15 rebounds. The Mavericks continue to excel without Doncic, now 6-2 in his absence, with a strong contribution from their bench which outscored the Clippers' reserves 46-24. The Clippers will continue their road trip in Memphis, while the Mavericks will face the Portland Trail Blazers next.

**San Antonio Spurs 114 - 94 Portland Trail Blazers**  
Victor Wembanyama delivered a standout performance with 30 points and 10 blocks, leading the San Antonio Spurs to a commanding 114-94 win over the Portland Trail Blazers. Notably, Wembanyama made history as the first NBA player to achieve four 3-pointers and 10 blocks in a single game and became the first player under 21 to have multiple double-figure block games since 1974. He also matched his career high with his 10th block and recorded the 15th fastest journey to 200 career 3-pointers in NBA history. Charles Bassey contributed a double-double with 16 points and 12 rebounds, while Devin Vassell added 11 points. The Spurs, improving to 15-13, secured their largest victory margin this season and continue their strong run, winning four straight against Portland. Despite Shaedon Sharpe's 25 points and Anfernee Simons’ 18, Portland struggled, dropping nine of their last 11 games and hitting only 12 of 43 from beyond the arc.

**Phoenix Suns 125 - 133 Detroit Pistons**  
In an impressive performance, Cade Cunningham led the Detroit Pistons to a 133-125 victory over the Phoenix Suns, recording 28 points and 13 assists. Despite Kevin Durant's season-high 43 points, coupled with Bradley Beal's 26, the Suns were hampered by 19 turnovers. Detroit had seven players score in double figures, including Jalen Duren who notched a double-double with 17 points and 11 rebounds. The Pistons established control early, racing to a 41-26 lead by the end of the first quarter, largely capitalizing on Phoenix's turnovers. Playing without Devin Booker due to a left groin injury, the Suns struggled defensively and couldn't overcome their mistakes. A standout moment came when Malik Beasley hit a crucial 3-pointer to repel a late Suns rally, and Cunningham sealed the win with another three in the final moments. Despite shooting nearly 62% from the field over the initial three quarters, the Suns' sloppy play and exemptions on defense proved costly. The victory marked the Pistons' third win in their last five games, while the Suns have now lost 12 of their last 18 after a strong start to the season.
