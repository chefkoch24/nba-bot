**Orlando Magic 103 - 96 Cleveland Cavaliers**  
Paolo Banchero led the Orlando Magic to victory with 27 points, overcoming Donovan Mitchell's 50-point performance to beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 103-96 and force a Game 7. Banchero scored 10 crucial points in the fourth quarter, while Franz Wagner added 26 points and Jalen Suggs contributed with 22 points. Mitchell carried the Cavs with all 18 points in the fourth quarter, but poor three-point shooting played a factor in their loss. Game 7 will be in Cleveland, where the Cavs have a strong home record, and the Magic are seeking their first series win in 14 years under coach Jamahl Mosley after significantly improving their record this season.

**Dallas Mavericks 114 - 101 LA Clippers**  
The Los Angeles Clippers are confident they can still defeat the Dallas Mavericks after a disappointing Game 5 loss. The Clippers, without star forward Kawhi Leonard, struggled offensively and defensively in the last game. Despite Luka Doncic's impressive performance for the Mavericks, the Clippers believe they can turn things around in Game 6. The Mavericks are also aware of the Clippers' potential and are preparing for a tough matchup. The series stands at 3-2 in favor of Dallas, but the Clippers are determined to fight back and potentially advance to the next round of the playoffs.
