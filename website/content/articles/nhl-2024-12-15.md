The Los Angeles Kings secured a commanding 5-1 victory against the New York Rangers at Madison Square Garden, marking their seventh win in eight games. Adrian Kempe, Alex Turcotte, Quinton Byfield, and Warren Foegele each contributed a goal and an assist, while Darcy Kuemper made 31 saves for the Kings, rebounding from a previous loss to the New Jersey Devils.

Notably, Byfield reached his 100th career point with an assist, and the Kings achieved their fastest three-goal span on the road since 2019.
