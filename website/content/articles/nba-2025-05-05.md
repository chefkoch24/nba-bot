**Houston Rockets 89 - 103 Golden State Warriors**  
In a decisive Game 7 victory, the Golden State Warriors defeated the Houston Rockets 103-89 to advance to the Western Conference semifinals. Key performances included Buddy Hield's impressive shooting display with nine 3-pointers leading to 33 points, setting an NBA record for a Game 7. Stephen Curry contributed significantly in the fourth quarter, scoring 14 of his 22 points, and displaying his famous "night night" gesture as the Warriors pulled away. Despite trailing by 12 at halftime, the Rockets, led by Amen Thompson’s 24 points, rallied to close the gap but ultimately fell short. The Warriors became the seventh No. 7 seed to advance to the semifinals, eliminating the Rockets for the fifth time in playoff history. Jimmy Butler, a crucial mid-season acquisition, added to the Warriors' solid performance with 20 points, eight rebounds, and seven assists. The Rockets struggled with consistency, despite Fred VanVleet's strong showing earlier in the series, and Jalen Green’s considerably diminished contribution in this game. The Warriors will now face the Timberwolves on Tuesday in Minnesota.

**Cleveland Cavaliers 112 - 121 Indiana Pacers**  
In an unexpected Game 1 victory of the Eastern Conference semifinals, the Indiana Pacers, led by Tyrese Haliburton, edged out the top-seeded Cleveland Cavaliers with a 121-112 win. Haliburton, often labeled overrated, scored 22 points, including a pivotal go-ahead 3-pointer in the fourth quarter, and dished out 13 assists, contributing to Indiana's intense offensive momentum. Despite only hitting 2 of 6 from beyond the arc, his crucial plays and defense shifted the game in Indiana's favor. Andrew Nembhard added 23 points with timely shooting, while all Pacers starters scored in double figures. Defensively, Haliburton's standout effort included blocking a critical 3-point attempt by Max Strus, cementing Indiana's lead. Meanwhile, Donovan Mitchell’s 33 points broke Michael Jordan’s record for eight straight 30-point games in playoff series openers, yet Cleveland struggled with their 3-point shooting, converting just 9 of 38, which was pivotal in their loss. Lacking Darius Garland due to injury, Cleveland was also unable to adjust to Indiana's pace, a concern for coach Kenny Atkinson, who hopes to regain control in Game 2 despite the Pacers' aggressive tempo and adept shot-making.
