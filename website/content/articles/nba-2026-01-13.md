**Indiana Pacers 98 - 96 Boston Celtics**  
Pascal Siakam's clutch performance led the Indiana Pacers to an unexpected 98-96 victory over the Boston Celtics, marking their first three-game winning streak of the season. Siakam tallied 21 points, including a critical 7-foot bank shot with only 6.1 seconds left, capping off an impressive game where he also contributed eight rebounds and six assists. The Celtics' Derrick White, who had tied the game with a layup just seconds earlier, missed a last-second three-pointer that could have clinched the win for Boston. Missing their top scorer Jaylen Brown, the Celtics struggled without him due to back spasms and his recent fine for referee criticism. Jay Huff supported the Pacers' triumph with 20 points, reflecting a turnaround as the team, which started the night with the NBA's worst record, moved ahead of the New Orleans Pelicans.

**Sacramento Kings 124 - 112 Los Angeles Lakers**  
In a spirited rematch, the Sacramento Kings, despite having the NBA's third-worst record, managed to defeat the Los Angeles Lakers 111-98, breaking their seven-game losing streak. The game occurred without the Kings’ veteran guard Dennis Schroder, who was serving a suspension for an altercation with the Lakers’ Luka Doncic after a previous matchup. This suspension pushed the Kings to adapt, leading to increased playing time for Malik Monk, who delivered an impressive 15-point performance. Sacramento's DeMar DeRozan marked a significant milestone by surpassing 26,000 career points, becoming the 23rd player in NBA history to do so. The Lakers struggled, facing their second consecutive loss and sixth defeat in ten games, with Doncic falling short of his typical scoring average and LeBron James contributing a near triple-double. Rui Hachimura returned to the Lakers' lineup following a right calf strain, eager to help the team improve amidst their recent challenges.
