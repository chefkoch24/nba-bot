**Atlanta Hawks 105 - 121 New York Knicks**  
The New York Knicks powered past the Atlanta Hawks with a decisive 121-105 victory, largely thanks to Karl-Anthony Towns' impressive 30 points and 11 rebounds. The Knicks solidified their third-place standing in the Eastern Conference by shooting 53.6% from the field and making 15 of 29 three-pointers. OG Anunoby contributed 24 points, while Mikal Bridges added 20. The Knicks pulled ahead with a dominant second quarter, outscoring the Hawks 40-22 and leading 78-53 at halftimeâ€”marking the most points allowed by Atlanta before halftime this season. For the Hawks, Trae Young set a new team record for assists in a season and achieved his 500th career steal, despite Atlanta being resigned to the play-in tournament after losing their third consecutive and fifth in six games. The injured Jalen Brunson of the Knicks, pivotal in prior games, was notably absent for the 15th consecutive match. Both teams are set to play again on Sunday, with Atlanta hosting Utah and the Knicks facing off against Phoenix.

**Detroit Pistons 103 - 109 Memphis Grizzlies**  
Desmond Bane's impressive 38-point performance led the Memphis Grizzlies to a 109-103 victory over the Detroit Pistons, marking their ninth consecutive win against Detroit. Despite Ja Morant's absence due to illness, the Grizzlies prevailed with the help of Zach Edey's career-high 21 rebounds and Jaren Jackson's 27 points and 11 rebounds. Cade Cunningham returned for the Pistons with 25 points after a six-game absence, but Detroit, hindered by Jalen Duren's injury, struggled with matchups as Ausar Thompson, who tallied 18 points and 11 rebounds, was forced to guard the significantly taller Edey. Although Detroit closed the gap to 93-91 with under four minutes left, Bane's crucial three-pointer in the final minute sealed the Grizzlies' win. Memphis, despite early shooting struggles, capitalized on offensive rebounds and second-chance points to maintain their competitive edge.

**Philadelphia 76ers 109 - 114 Minnesota Timberwolves**  
Anthony Edwards played a pivotal role with 37 points, including a crucial 3-pointer in the final moments, as the Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Philadelphia 76ers 114-109, extending their winning streak to five games. Rudy Gobert was dominant with 23 points and 19 rebounds, while Julius Randle and Donte DiVincenzo contributed significantly. The win places Minnesota in contention for a top-six playoff spot in the Western Conference. Despite losing their 11th consecutive game, the 76ers, without key players due to injuries, showed resilience with Quentin Grimes leading the team with 28 points. Edwards' impressive performance marked him as the third player in NBA history to reach 300 3-pointers in just 75 games, joining Stephen Curry and James Harden. The Sixers' losing streak matches the 15th-longest in their history since 2016. Minnesota will continue their road trip against Milwaukee, while Philadelphia faces Miami next.

**Miami Heat 115 - 121 Milwaukee Bucks**  
Giannis Antetokounmpo's stellar performance with 36 points, 15 rebounds, and 10 assists led the Milwaukee Bucks to a 121-115 overtime victory against the Miami Heat, elevating the Bucks to the fifth spot in the Eastern Conference and securing their playoff berth. Kevin Porter Jr. contributed significantly off the bench, scoring 24 points, including a crucial layup in the final seconds of overtime, while Bam Adebayo shined for Miami with 31 points and 12 rebounds. The Heat, playing without key players like Tyler Herro and Kevin Love, fell slightly behind in the playoff race. In a notable moment, Antetokounmpo honored Bucks coach Doc Rivers by gifting him the game ball from a previous standout performance, celebrating Rivers' climb to No. 7 on the all-time wins list. Meanwhile, Miami's coach Erik Spoelstra applauded managing general partner Micky Arison's induction into the Basketball Hall of Fame, highlighting his impact on South Florida sports.

**LA Clippers 135 - 104 Dallas Mavericks**  
In a decisive 114-91 victory over the Dallas Mavericks, James Harden's impressive performance stood out with 29 points and 14 assists, contributing to the Clippers' 13th win in their last 16 games as they chase a top-six spot in the Western Conference. Kawhi Leonard's availability for the rematch is uncertain, given his recovery from knee issues and pattern of not playing consecutive nights, though he added 20 points in just 24 minutes in the first game. The Clippers' robust defense, which ranks fourth in the NBA, was pivotal, and their recent success at their new home arena has been fueled by a strong 27-7 record since overcoming initial hiccups. Despite the Mavericks' setback without key players such as Anthony Davis and Dereck Lively II, and with Klay Thompson leaving due to illness, the team remains focused on securing a play-in spot in the playoffs amid a tight race with the Sacramento Kings and Phoenix Suns.
