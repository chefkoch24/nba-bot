**Detroit Pistons 119 - 113 Boston Celtics**  
The Detroit Pistons edged out the Boston Celtics with a 119-113 victory, led by Cade Cunningham's 25 points and Jalen Duren's standout performance, which included 24 points and 17 rebounds. Despite Jaylen Brown's impressive 41-point effort for Boston, the Celtics couldn't maintain their early 14-2 lead, eventually surrendering 70 combined points in the second and third quarters. Detroit capitalized on second-chance opportunities, with 30 points in that category, including crucial points by Ausar Thompson in the closing moments. Tobias Harris added 18 points, securing a pivotal offensive rebound that helped the Pistons stave off a late surge by the Celtics. The Celtics, missing key players such as Jayson Tatum and having lost contributors like Jrue Holiday, Kristaps Porzingis, and Al Horford, have started the season 0-3. This win marked Detroit's second consecutive victory after an initial loss, and before the game, Pistons coach J.B. Bickerstaff addressed the need for caution regarding potential gambling implications in conversations, a topic of interest amid the NBA's ongoing gambling scandal. The teams are set to continue their schedules with the Celtics facing New Orleans and the Pistons hosting Cleveland on Monday.

The Cleveland Cavaliers secured a 118-113 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks in their home opener, with Donovan Mitchell scoring 24 points and Evan Mobley adding 23 while maintaining a perfect 12 for 12 from the free-throw line—a feat last achieved by LeBron James in 2014.

Cleveland's balanced attack featured contributions from Sam Merrill with 17 points and De'Andre Hunter, who returned from a knee injury, scoring 16 points. Despite being shorthanded due to injuries to Kyle Kuzma, Cole Anthony, and Kevin Porter Jr., Milwaukee was kept competitive by Giannis Antetokounmpo's near triple-double effort with 40 points, 14 rebounds, and nine assists. AJ Green added 20 points for the Bucks, who mounted a comeback to tie at 98 in the fourth quarter. However, critical scores from Cleveland in the final minutes, including a timely pair of free throws by Mobley, secured their win.

Bam Adebayo contributed 19 points and 13 rebounds, while Jaime Jaquez Jr. added 17 points in the Heat's home opener.

This game marked Miami's first at home since guard Terry Rozier was placed on leave following federal charges related to a sports betting scheme. Jalen Brunson shone for the Knicks with 37 points, and Mikal Bridges added 20, but a crucial 23-6 run by Miami in the third quarter gave them an 18-point lead, which they maintained despite a late Knicks surge. The Knicks, who had hoped to start the season 3-0 for only the second time in 26 years, were hampered by Miami's dominance at the free throw line and now face Milwaukee next, while the Heat will host Charlotte.

**Washington Wizards 113 - 139 Charlotte Hornets**  
LaMelo Ball's impressive triple-double performance, featuring 38 points, 13 rebounds, and 13 assists, was the driving force behind the Charlotte Hornets' dynamic 139-113 victory over the Washington Wizards. The Hornets overturned a substantial halftime deficit, benefiting from Kon Knueppel's crucial 11-point contribution in the third-quarter surge and Miles Bridges' 22-point effort, snapping their five-game losing streak against Washington. Charlotte's remarkable 67.4% shooting in the second half included hitting 12 of 16 from beyond the arc. Despite a strong start from the Wizards, with Alex Sarr contributing 17 of his 21 points in the first half and CJ McCollum scoring 24 points, the home team couldn't maintain their lead. Ball's pivotal 3-pointer in the third quarter secured a lead Charlotte never relinquished, and Sion James added significant support by scoring all his 13 points in the second half, notably during a commanding 19-4 run. The Hornets' dominant 44-25 fourth quarter sealed the game, marking Ball's first triple-double since November 5, 2023, while Washington's rookie Tre Johnson collected 18 points in his home debut.

**Minnesota Timberwolves 114 - 110 Indiana Pacers**  
In a tense game in Minneapolis, the Minnesota Timberwolves secured a 114-110 victory over the depleted Indiana Pacers, despite losing star player Anthony Edwards to hamstring tightness early on. Julius Randle was instrumental, scoring 31 points, 20 of which came in the first half, while Rudy Gobert contributed significantly with 14 points and 19 rebounds. Donte DiVincenzo and Naz Reid also played key roles in maintaining the team's lead. Despite a strong performance from Pascal Siakam, who scored 33 points for the Pacers, the team was short-handed due to multiple injuries, including the absence of Tyrese Haliburton and Bennedict Mathurin. The Timberwolves' third-quarter surge, aided by drawing 11 fouls and the excitement of their home opener featuring Kevin Garnett-era uniforms, helped them maintain their lead even as the game tightened in the final moments.

Despite Scottie Barnes's impressive 33 points and 11 rebounds for the Raptors, Toronto couldn't overcome Dallas's momentum.

**Sacramento Kings 120 - 127 Los Angeles Lakers**  
Austin Reaves delivered an impressive performance, achieving a career-high 51 points to guide the Los Angeles Lakers to a 127-120 victory over the Sacramento Kings, despite the absence of Luka Doncic due to injury. Reaves' stellar contribution included making 12 of 22 field goals, sinking six 3-pointers, and recording nine assists and 11 rebounds. This feat positioned him among a select group of players, including Doncic, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden, who have recorded similar stats in the last 40 years. Reaves' performance brought back memories of Elgin Baylor's 50-plus points game in 1963. DeAndre Ayton and Rui Hachimura added 22 and 18 points, respectively, for the Lakers, who managed an early lead despite also missing LeBron James. The Kings, led by Zach LaVine's 32 points, managed to tie the game at halftime but were ultimately outpaced by the Lakers' strong finish led by Reaves’ crucial plays in the fourth quarter.
