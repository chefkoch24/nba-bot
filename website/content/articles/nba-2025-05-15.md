**Boston Celtics 127 - 102 New York Knicks**  
In a crucial Game 5, the Boston Celtics staved off elimination by defeating the New York Knicks 127-102, keeping their playoff hopes alive despite missing star player Jayson Tatum due to a season-ending Achilles injury. Derrick White stepped up in Tatum's absence, scoring 34 points with seven 3-pointers, while Jaylen Brown added 26 points and 12 assists. Payton Pritchard contributed 17 points with five 3s, and Luke Kornet made a significant impact with 10 points, nine rebounds, and seven blocks, filling in for the physically struggling Kristaps Porzingis. The Celtics, who connected on 22 3-pointers, are aiming to become the 14th team in NBA history to overcome a 3-1 series deficit, with the potential for a Game 7 on Monday if they win the next match in New York. The game was marked by its physicality, including a brief altercation between Josh Hart and Brown, and the Knicks' Jalen Brunson fouled out in the fourth quarter, hindering their efforts to close out the series. Despite the ambitions of the Knicks, who at one point held a nine-point lead, the Celtics' urgency and focus on dominating the long-range shot carried them through to a commanding victory.

**Minnesota Timberwolves 121 - 110 Golden State Warriors**  
The Minnesota Timberwolves advanced to the Western Conference finals for the second year in a row by defeating the Golden State Warriors 121-110 in Game 5. Julius Randle was pivotal in the victory, scoring 29 points on efficient shooting, while Anthony Edwards contributed 22 points and 12 assists for the sixth-seeded Wolves. Without Stephen Curry, sidelined due to a hamstring injury, the Warriors struggled offensively despite strong efforts from Brandin Podziemski, who scored a playoff career-high 28 points, and Jonathan Kuminga with 26 points. The Warriors faced their first four-game postseason losing streak since 1972. Meanwhile, the Timberwolves benefitted from Rudy Gobert's defensive presence, Mike Conley's playmaking, and outstanding team shooting, particularly inside the arc, connecting on 77% of their two-point attempts. The Wolves' combination of relentless pace and scoring depth propelled them past a defensively challenging Warriors team, setting up a conference final against the Denver-Oklahoma City winner.
