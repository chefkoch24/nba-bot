**Detroit Red Wings 6 - 4 Philadelphia Flyers**  
In an energetic encounter at Little Caesars Arena, Patrick Kane led the Detroit Red Wings to a 6-4 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers by scoring the go-ahead goal in the third period and providing an assist. Kane's decisive goal, his 78th career game-winner, broke a tie with Bill Guerin for the fourth-most among U.S.-born players and edged him closer to Joe Pavelski's goal record. Lucas Raymond sealed the victory with an empty-net goal while adding an assist, and J.T. Compher contributed a goal and an assist as well. Despite Detroit losing top-pair defenseman Simon Edvinsson to injury in the first period, they managed to win three of their last four games. Flyers coach John Tortorella acknowledged his team's shortcomings, as Philadelphia fell back into old habits despite Travis Konecny's early goal and two assists from Sean Couturier, resulting in their fifth loss in seven games. The game was also notable for Flyers defenseman Cam York's unexpected absence for the last half of the match, with no immediate update from the team.

In a thrilling game, Joseph Woll made an impressive 36 saves as the Toronto Maple Leafs secured a 5-3 victory over the Dallas Stars at the American Airlines Center. This standout performance came just after the team announced that fellow goaltender Anthony Stolarz would be sidelined for 4-6 weeks due to a knee procedure. William Nylander was pivotal, scoring twice, including an empty-net goal to seal the win, taking his season tally to 20 goals. The game saw a back-and-forth battle with Dallas initially taking the lead through Sam Steel and later goals by Max Domi and Evgenii Dadonov, who also added an assist. Nichole Robertson contributed with a goal and an assist for Toronto, who have now won four of their last five games. Notably, Jamie Benn set a franchise record with his 1,143rd game played for Dallas.

**Minnesota Wild 1 - 6 Florida Panthers**  
In a decisive 6-1 victory over the Minnesota Wild at the Xcel Energy Center, Matthew Tkachuk led the Florida Panthers with two goals, marking their second consecutive win after a previous victory over the Edmonton Oilers. Aaron Ekblad contributed with a goal and two assists, while Mackie Samoskevich added a goal and an assist, showcasing Florida's strong offensive play. Sergei Bobrovsky was solid in net, making 26 saves. For the Wild, Marco Rossi scored their sole goal, but the team's defense struggled, resulting in their first back-to-back regulation losses of the season. Arctic controversies during the game included a successful challenge by Florida that nullified a Kirill Kaprizov goal due to goaltender interference and a successful Minnesota challenge that negated an Aleksander Barkov score due to an offside. Marc-Andre Fleury countered with 28 saves for Minnesota, but it was insufficient to stop the Panthers' offensive onslaught.

Troy Terry's last-minute goal capped a thrilling comeback for the Anaheim Ducks, who defeated the Winnipeg Jets 3-2 at the Honda Center. With just 26 seconds left on the clock, Terry capitalized on a turnover to secure the victory.
