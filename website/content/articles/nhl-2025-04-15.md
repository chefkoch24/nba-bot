Utah Hockey Club triumphed over the Nashville Predators with a decisive 7-3 victory at Bridgestone Arena, extending their point streak to five games. Clayton Keller was pivotal in the win, amassing two goals and two assists, marking him as one of only three NHL players in history to notch 60 assists during an inaugural season, alongside legends Wayne Gretzky and Mike Rogers.
