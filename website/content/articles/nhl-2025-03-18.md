**Boston Bruins 2 - 3 Buffalo Sabres**  
The Buffalo Sabres edged past the struggling Boston Bruins 3-2 in an overtime thriller at TD Garden, with Alex Tuch netting a power-play goal just 11 seconds before the end of overtime. Owen Power played a pivotal role, scoring a goal and assisting twice, while Peyton Krebs also found the net for the Sabres, who have bounced back from a rough patch, winning three out of their last four games. The Bruins, who have now lost three consecutive games, were held to fewer than 20 shots for the second consecutive game. Despite the loss, Morgan Geekie had a notable performance with a goal and an assist for Boston, which lags behind the New York Rangers in the race for a Stanley Cup Playoff wildcard spot. Bruins coach Joe Sacco highlighted the need to maintain focus and adhere to their game process, while Geekie emphasized the importance of a more straightforward approach in the offensive zone. Notably, Tuch’s game-winner ranks as the sixth-latest in Sabres history, and Power matched his career points record with his contribution in this game.

**Tampa Bay Lightning 2 - 0 Philadelphia Flyers**  
Vasilevskiy stops 21, Lightning shut out Flyers to gain in Atlantic
 **TAMPA --** <forge-entity title="Andrei Vasilevskiy" slug="andrei-vasilevskiy-8476883" code="player">Andrei Vasilevskiy</forge-entity> made 21 saves for the Tampa Bay Lightning in a 2-0 win against the Philadelphia Flyers at Amalie Arena on Monday. 
The shutout was Vasilevskiy’s fifth of the season and 39th in the NHL.

"The regular season is about ups and downs, it's basically an 82-game preparation for the playoffs," Vasilevskiy said. "We want to feel good about our game. The commitment to play defense helps a lot to boost my numbers. It's a team effort. No goalie in this league can be successful without a good team."

<forge-entity title="Nikita Kucherov" slug="nikita-kucherov-8476453" code="player">Nikita Kucherov</forge-entity> had a goal and an assist for the Lightning (39-23-5), who won their second in a row and pulled within two points of the Florida Panthers for first place in the Atlantic Division with a game in hand. Tampa Bay lost to Philadelphia 4-3 in a shootout on Thursday.

"This was not our best night, we just turned the puck over way too often; we were fortunate that Philly wasn't capitalizing on it," Lightning coach Jon Cooper said. "We simplified our game and got better...but we've got to play way better than that going into Dallas, Utah and Vegas.” 
<forge-entity title="Ivan Fedotov" slug="ivan-fedotov-8478905" code="player">Ivan Fedotov</forge-entity> made 21 saves for the Flyers (28-33-8), who have lost seven of eight (1-7-0) and were shut out for the second straight game following a 5-0 loss to the Carolina Hurricanes on Saturday. Philadelphia remained eight points behind the New York Rangers for the second wild card into the Stanley Cup Playoffs from the Eastern Conference.

"We were patient, something we needed to be, I thought \[Fedotov\] played really well," Flyers coach John Tortorella said. "The goaltending was good. I thought we played hard. I thought we checked really well and the patience level was good. We just needed someone to score a goal."

Kucherov gave Tampa Bay a 1-0 lead at 18:31 of the first period when he forced <forge-entity title="Travis Konecny" slug="travis-konecny-8478439" code="player">Travis Konecny</forge-entity> into a turnover at the blue line and scored on a breakaway, beating Fedotov with a forehand high to the stick side.

"We played well, other than that mishap I had there 4-on-4, and they got a break there," Konecny said. "We were in that game the whole time." 
<forge-entity title="Jake Guentzel" slug="jake-guentzel-8477404" code="player">Jake Guentzel</forge-entity> made it 2-0 at 18:30 of the third period on the power play with an empty-net goal.

"That's two out of the past three games taking a penalty when we're trying to get the goalie out, which is frustrating," Tortorella said.

Said Lightning defenseman <forge-entity title="Ryan McDonagh" slug="ryan-mcdonagh-8474151" code="player">Ryan McDonagh</forge-entity>: "We knew it was going to be a grinding, patient game. We didn't create a lot tonight, but you have to give them credit, they defend hard and work hard. It was great for us to find a way."

Philadelphia was 0-for-5 on the power play, failing to score on a four-minute man-advantage in the second period when Lightning defenseman <forge-entity title="Emil Lilleberg" slug="emil-martinsen-lilleberg-8482929" code="player">Emil Lilleberg</forge-entity> was given a double minor for high-sticking.

"We've got to score a goal," Tortorella said. "The four-minute penalty...it's not good enough. We needed a play off our power play, and we didn't get it."

The Flyers have failed to score on their previous 23 power plays.

"We're collapsing and trying to get numbers to the net," Konecny said. "We're not trying to be fancy, just trying to bounce one off somebody.

**NOTES:** Vasilevskiy’s fifth shutout tied <forge-entity title="Igor Shesterkin" slug="igor-shesterkin-8478048" code="player">Igor Shesterkin</forge-entity> for the second most in the NHL this season, behind <forge-entity title="Connor Hellebuyck" slug="connor-hellebuyck-8476945" code="player">Connor Hellebuyck</forge-entity> (six). … Tampa Bay won for the first time this season after scoring two goals or fewer (1-15-3). ...The Lightning penalty kill is 27-for-29 over the past 10 games. ...

**Columbus Blue Jackets 1 - 2 New Jersey Devils**  
In a thrilling matchup at Nationwide Arena, Jake Allen's stellar performance, making 45 saves including 23 in the third period, helped the New Jersey Devils secure a 2-1 victory over the Columbus Blue Jackets. Timo Meier and Jesper Bratt were pivotal for the Devils, scoring 39 seconds apart in the second period, as the Devils improved to win four of their last five games.
