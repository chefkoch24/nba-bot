**Toronto Raptors 101 - 111 Boston Celtics**  
The Boston Celtics clinched their sixth consecutive win by defeating the Toronto Raptors 111-101 on Tuesday night, with Jaylen Brown leading the charge with 24 points. Derrick White contributed significantly by scoring 22 points and going 6 for 11 from beyond the arc, outpacing the entire Raptors lineup in 3-point shooting. Boston, now boasting a 24-6 road record, saw notable performances from Payton Pritchard with 20 points and Jayson Tatum with 19 points and a career-high 11 assists in the first half. Despite RJ Barrett's 22 points and Scottie Barnes' 21 for Toronto, the Raptors struggled from long range, making just 5 of 32 attempts, their lowest of the season. The match also highlighted a roster shift for Boston with Kristaps Porzingis out due to illness, and Torrey Craig stepping into his first start for the team. This game marked a missed opportunity for Toronto, who had broken a losing streak against Boston in January but couldn't replicate that success. Both teams are set to face road games the following night, with Boston heading to Detroit and Toronto to Indiana.

**Orlando Magic 82 - 122 Cleveland Cavaliers**  
The Cleveland Cavaliers extended their winning streak to eight games with a commanding 122-82 victory over the Orlando Magic in Orlando. Ty Jerome led the scoring effort with 20 points in just 21 minutes, while Max Strus, Evan Mobley, and De’Andre Hunter each contributed 17 points. Strus was particularly effective from beyond the arc, sinking five of Cleveland's 19 successful 3-pointers out of 32 attempts. The Cavaliers, currently boasting an NBA-best record of 48-10, shot an impressive 56.3% overall even without All-Star guard Darius Garland, who sat out due to a left hip contusion. In contrast, the Magic struggled from the three-point line, with Paolo Banchero's 26 points and Franz Wagner’s 19 points insufficient to turn the tide, shooting only 5 for 28 from deep. Notably, Cleveland's victory marked a turnaround from their previous playoff woes in Orlando, where they averaged a meager 89.3 points and shot just 24.1% from three-point range. Orlando faced another setback with Cole Anthony exiting the game after a knee injury, while the Cavaliers look ahead to their upcoming match against Boston.

The Bucks struggled with offensive consistency, failing to score in the fourth quarter until Damian Lillard's free throws six minutes in. The game ended with Lillard's missed 3-point attempt following a chaotic jump ball sequence. This victory snapped Milwaukee's four-game winning streak.

**Golden State Warriors 128 - 92 Charlotte Hornets**  
The Golden State Warriors continued their strong form at home with a commanding 126-102 victory over the Dallas Mavericks, showcasing their strength ahead of a road trip beginning Thursday. This win was part of a short homestand amid a demanding 14-game period that started with seven consecutive road games. The recent acquisition of Jimmy Butler has reinvigorated the Warriors, helping them secure five wins out of six, thanks to his high basketball IQ and ability to connect plays. Since joining on February 8, Butler has consistently performed, scoring at least 17 points in each game and demonstrating remarkable accuracy from the free-throw line. As they prepare to face the Charlotte Hornets, Butler will be familiar with this opponent, having faced them twice earlier in the season. For the Hornets, they've struggled on the road, recently suffering heavy losses despite some standout performances from players like Mark Williams and LaMelo Ball, who is cautiously managing his return from an ankle injury.

**Los Angeles Lakers 107 - 99 Dallas Mavericks**  
In a much-anticipated matchup following a blockbuster trade deadline, the Los Angeles Lakers, featuring their new star Luka Doncic, are set to clash with the Dallas Mavericks, who have acquired Anthony Davis in their lineup. Despite health challenges, Doncic impressed in a recent Lakers victory over the Denver Nuggets, scoring a team-high 32 points, while Anthony Davis remains sidelined due to an abdominal injury after a strong debut for the Mavericks. The Lakers, with a record of 2-2 since Doncic joined, are buoyed by strong performances from LeBron James and Austin Reaves, who have been crucial to their recent successes. Meanwhile, the Mavericks, having gone 1-1 since the All-Star break, struggle with consistency as evidenced by their recent loss to the Warriors, marked by turnovers and rebounds issues. As the Lakers' defense shines with a season-high 15 steals, the upcoming game will center around stopping Doncic, a challenge openly acknowledged by the Mavericks' Kyrie Irving and P.J. Washington.
