Troy Terry opened the scoring for the Ducks, capitalizing on a broken stick mishap by Nashville's Justin Barron, while Killorn netted the game-winning goal in the third period during a 3-on-2 rush. Despite Nashville's efforts, including a goal from Jakub Vrana during a power play, they failed to capitalize on a crucial two-man advantage late in the game. The Ducks' win was highlighted by their resilience and key defensive stands, such as killing a 5-on-3 penalty. Notably, Anaheim's Leo Carlsson continued his impressive form with an assist, reaching 60 career points, becoming the third Ducks player aged 20 or younger to achieve this milestone.
