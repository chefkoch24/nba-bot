**Chicago Blackhawks 3 - 4 Ottawa Senators**  
Tim Stutzle scored just 46 seconds into overtime to lift the Ottawa Senators to a 4-3 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks at the United Center. This goal, which went in off his skate and was upheld after a video review, extended his impressive point streak to an NHL career-high 13 games. Stutzle’s performance marks him as the fourth player in Senators history to reach such a streak, matching teammates like Drake Batherson and legends like Marian Hossa. The Senators, having struggled with six losses in their last seven games, managed a critical win thanks to contributions from Josh Norris and other teammates, securing an essential victory in the tight Eastern Conference playoff race. For the Blackhawks, Ryan Donato scored his 100th NHL goal, extending his point streak to six games. Despite the loss, Chicago's interim coach Anders Sorensen highlighted the team's strong play in the latter periods, acknowledging their defensive efforts amidst rebuilding momentum.
