“Everyone brings something different to the line,” Rossi said. “\[Boldy\] brings the size and a shooting mentality. Me and ‘Zuccie’ are more for passes, but lately I’m scoring more. So today in pregame skate, Zuccie told me I should pass it more, so I tried today."

“Consistency has been the big issue with our group,” Carolina coach Rod Brind’Amour said. “We play really well, and then not so good. We’ve got to get a little more to our identity every game.”

The Wild set the tone early in the first period when they held the Hurricanes to one shot during a high-sticking double minor to <forge-entity title="Joel Eriksson Ek" slug="joel-eriksson-ek-8478493" code="player">Joel Eriksson Ek</forge-entity>.

Minnesota went ahead 1-0 at 13:03 of the first period when Zuccarello took a pass from Rossi and scored on a one-timer from the top of the right face-off circle.

“I like the way we started tonight,” Wild coach John Hynes said. “I thought we had good energy; we were engaged. Details were strong, and we played the style of game we needed to win.”

“I thought we played well,” Zuccarello said. “We made plays, we made it hard for them.”

The shutout was the third of the season and ninth in the NHL for Gustavsson.

“Usually they shoot a lot more here, and they’re always getting into your zone with a lot of speed,” Gustavsson said. “It was a fairly quiet night. Maybe they had a little tougher night than usual, and we played very good defensively and blocked a lot of shots.”
