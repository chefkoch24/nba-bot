**New Jersey Devils 1 - 6 Winnipeg Jets**  
The Winnipeg Jets dominated the New Jersey Devils with a decisive 6-1 victory, led by Nikolaj Ehlers' standout performance of a goal and two assists. Josh Morrissey and Kyle Connor each contributed a goal and an assist, while Jets' goalie Connor Hellebuyck made 22 saves.

Among significant highlights, Alex Iafallo opened the scoring, and Adam Lowry capitalized on a defensive error by Simon Nemec, increasing the Jets' lead. In a notable milestone, Morrissey achieved his fourth consecutive 10-goal season, tying Dustin Byfuglien's record for most by a Jets/Thrashers defenseman, while Kyle Connor became the second-fastest player in franchise history to reach 80 points in a season. Additionally, it was a day of debuts, with Brandon Tanev making his first appearance for the Jets this season after being traded from the Seattle Kraken, and Brian Dumoulin debuting for the Devils following a trade from the Anaheim Ducks.

**Washington Capitals 5 - 2 Detroit Red Wings**  
In a thrilling game at Capital One Arena, Aliaksei Protas starred with two goals and an assist in the third period to propel the Washington Capitals to a 5-2 comeback victory over the Detroit Red Wings. Protas, who notably improved from last season, helped Washington rally from a 2-0 deficit with a short-handed goal and contributed to two more goals in quick succession. Tom Wilson also scored a goal and assisted, while Logan Thompson made 17 saves as the Capitals secured their third consecutive win. The Red Wings, struggling with a five-game losing streak, had early success with goals by Dylan Larkin and Moritz Seider but couldn’t maintain their momentum. A notable fact from the game is that Protas and Wilson became the first Capitals players since 2006 to each record two short-handed points in a single game. Alex Ovechkin remains one goal shy of becoming the 11th player in NHL history to reach 1,600 career points.
