**Baltimore Ravens 23 - 26 Las Vegas Raiders**  
Gardner Minshew propelled the Las Vegas Raiders to a thrilling 26-23 comeback victory against the Baltimore Ravens with three fourth-quarter scoring drives. Despite trailing 23-13 after Derrick Henry's touchdown early in the fourth quarter, Minshew led the Raiders to tie the game with a 1-yard TD pass to Davante Adams. A go-ahead 38-yard field goal by Daniel Carlson with 27 seconds left sealed the win. Minshew threw for 276 yards, a remarkable feat given his 15-23 career record and the Raiders' previous offensive struggles. Derrick Henry shined for Baltimore with 84 rushing yards, but Lamar Jackson was limited to 20 yards rushing, far below his previous week's performance. The Raiders' resilient offense and key defensive plays, including an interception by Robert Spillane, were pivotal in upsetting a Ravens team that had the NFL's best record last year. This defeat marks Baltimore's first 0-2 start since 2015.

**Jacksonville Jaguars 13 - 18 Cleveland Browns**  
In a rainy showdown, the Cleveland Browns edged out the Jacksonville Jaguars 18-13, with Deshaun Watson scoring a rushing touchdown and Dustin Hopkins adding three field goals. The Browns' defense sacked Jaguars' quarterback Trevor Lawrence four times, largely keeping Jacksonville at bay. Lawrence found rookie receiver Brian Thomas Jr. for a 66-yard gain to set up a late-game touchdown, narrowing the score. Despite a chance to clinch the game, penalties pushed the Browns back, but a strategic punt and a crucial sack by Alex Wright in the end zone preserved their lead. The Jaguars’ attempt to win in the final moments fell short as Lawrence's end-zone pass fell incomplete. Lawrence’s sideline argument with coach Doug Pederson highlighted Jacksonville's frustrations, marking their seventh loss in eight games. Despite the loss, Jacksonville running back Travis Etienne moved up in the franchise’s all-time rushing ranks. Injuries hit both teams, with notable exits including Browns' WR David Bell and Jaguars' TE Evan Engram. The Browns will next host the New York Giants, while the Jaguars face the Buffalo Bills.

**Denver Broncos 6 - 13 Pittsburgh Steelers**  
Justin Fields led the Pittsburgh Steelers to a 13-6 victory over the Denver Broncos, marking his second consecutive win subbing for an injured Russell Wilson. In a game defined by defensive stands and missed offensive opportunities, Fields threw for 117 yards and a touchdown, while Denver's rookie QB Bo Nix threw two interceptions and couldn't find the end zone despite 246 passing yards. Nix's critical third-quarter interception halted Denver's best drive, facilitated by big plays from Courtland Sutton and Josh Reynolds. Pittsburgh capitalized on Denver's penalties, with Chris Boswell's field goals sealing the win. Russell Wilson, although sidelined, was notably given a game ball by Steelers coach Mike Tomlin, adding an emotional layer to his return to the Mile High City, where his tumultuous two-year stint ended. The Broncos' struggles persisted, partly due to injurious departures, with their scoring and yardage averages declining sharply since Wilson's departure.

**Detroit Lions 16 - 20 Tampa Bay Buccaneers**  
In a thrilling playoff rematch, Baker Mayfield led the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to a narrow 20-16 victory over the Detroit Lions with both a rushing and passing touchdown. Mayfield's standout moment came with an 11-yard zig-zagging touchdown run that secured the lead late in the third quarter, following his earlier 41-yard touchdown pass to Chris Godwin. Despite a valiant effort and stellar performances from Aidan Hutchinson, who had a career-high five sacks, and Amon-Ra St. Brown's 119 receiving yards, the Lions fell short due to costly mistakes, including two critical interceptions by Jared Goff and a significant coaching error that negated a potential field goal opportunity. The Bucs' defense held firm in the final moments, stopping the Lions twice in the red zone to seal the victory.

**Houston Texans 19 - 13 Chicago Bears**  
In a tightly contested game, the Houston Texans edged out the Chicago Bears 19-13, largely due to C.J. Stroud's 260 passing yards and a touchdown, complemented by Ka'imi Fairbairn's four long-range field goals from 56, 47, 59, and 53 yards. Despite Houston's offense struggling in the second half, their defense rose to the occasion, intercepting rookie quarterback Caleb Williams twice and sacking him seven times. Nico Collins shined with 135 yards receiving, despite Joe Mixon being limited to just 25 rushing yards after a stellar performance last week. The Bears rallied late with a Cairo Santos 54-yard field goal but were ultimately unable to overcome Houston's defensive pressure, as Williams was sacked and his fourth-down pass fell incomplete, sealing the Texans' victory.
