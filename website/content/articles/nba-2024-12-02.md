**Brooklyn Nets 92 - 100 Orlando Magic**  
The Orlando Magic secured a 100-92 victory over the Brooklyn Nets, marking their sixth consecutive win and 12th in the last 13 games, despite committing a season-high 22 turnovers. Franz Wagner led the Magic with a near triple-double performance, tallying 20 points, nine rebounds, and eight assists. Goga Bitadze contributed a double-double with 12 points and 13 rebounds, using Orlando's size advantage to dominate the paint and secure a 52-33 rebounding edge. The game featured 14 lead changes and 11 ties in a competitive first half before Orlando took control in the third quarter, though the Nets briefly surged ahead in the fourth. The Magic's league-leading defense clamped down to force six turnovers in the final quarter and limited Brooklyn, the league's second-best three-point shooting team, to just 25.8% shooting from beyond the arc. Camden Johnson's 26 points and Dennis Schroder's 20 points for the Nets weren't enough, as Brooklyn fell to 3-11 against the Eastern Conference this season.

Memphis surged in the third quarter, outscoring the Pacers 40-23, with key contributions also from Marcus Smart and Desmond Bane, each adding 16 points. The victory marked the Grizzlies’ sixth consecutive win. Notably, Andrew Nembhard returned for Indiana after a 14-game absence, scoring 14 first-half points, but did not play the second half as he was on limited minutes due to a knee issue. Both teams face tough opponents next, with Indiana visiting Toronto and Memphis traveling to Dallas on Tuesday.

**Cleveland Cavaliers 115 - 111 Boston Celtics**  
In a thrilling comeback, Donovan Mitchell led the Cleveland Cavaliers to a 115-111 victory over the Boston Celtics, snapping Boston's seven-game winning streak. Mitchell shone in the fourth quarter, scoring 20 of his 35 points and landing all six of his field-goal attempts, which included four three-pointers.

Boston, playing without starters Jaylen Brown and Derrick White, saw strong performances from Jayson Tatum with 33 points and Payton Pritchard with 24, but it wasn't enough. The Cavs' victory was sweet revenge for an earlier season loss to Boston after a perfect 15-0 start. Cleveland's Darius Garland contributed 22 points, while Boston's Kristaps Porzingis added 21. The game concluded with a critical mistake from Pritchard, who stepped into the lane early on an intentional missed free throw, giving the Cavs possession and allowing Mitchell to secure the game with two final free throws. Boston now looks to rebound against Miami, while Cleveland prepares to face Washington.

**New York Knicks 118 - 85 New Orleans Pelicans**  
Mikal Bridges led the New York Knicks to a dominating 118-85 victory over the injury-depleted New Orleans Pelicans, scoring 31 points on 12-of-19 shooting, including 7-of-12 from three-point range. The Knicks have now won seven of their last ten games, with contributions from Jalen Brunson, who added 16 points, and Miles McBride scoring 13 off the bench. Karl-Anthony Towns was a force on the boards, grabbing 19 rebounds, 17 of which came in the first half. Despite CJ McCollum's 13 points, the short-handed Pelicans, missing several key players like Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram, struggled offensively, shooting 35-for-94 overall and a dismal 4-of-27 from three-point range. New Orleans saw their losing streak extend to eight games, having won only one of their last 15, and continued their road woes with a 1-10 away record. The Knicks completely shut down the Pelicans' offense, allowing them only 28 first-half points and holding them to a mere 10 points in a first quarter marked by New Orleans missing 15 consecutive shots.

Despite missing a crucial three-pointer in the final seconds, the Lakers capitalized on a turnover by Utah’s Collin Sexton, who mishandled an inbound pass, preventing a potential game-winning shot. The Lakers, missing several key players due to injuries and illness, saw Davis dominate the third quarter and James take charge in the fourth, where he scored on four consecutive possessions to extend their lead. The Jazz, struggling with turnovers, lost for the eighth time in nine games, with Lauri Markkanen and John Collins leading their scoring.

**LA Clippers 126 - 122 Denver Nuggets**  
In a tense showdown, the Los Angeles Clippers narrowly lost 93-92 to the Minnesota Timberwolves during NBA Cup action, ending a 2-2 road stretch.

Despite the loss, coach Tyronn Lue praised the Clippers' robust defense which held their opponents to under 100 points for the sixth time in seven games. However, Denver Nuggets are facing defensive inconsistencies despite Nikola Jokic's standout form, which sees him edging closer to potentially winning his fourth MVP, as emphasized by Denver coach Michael Malone's critical remarks on the team's defense. Clippers' Norman Powell remains questionable due to a hamstring strain, while Kevin Porter Jr. will sit out the next game against the Denver Nuggets.
