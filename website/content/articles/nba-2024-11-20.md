**Boston Celtics 120 - 117 Cleveland Cavaliers**  
The Boston Celtics snapped the Cleveland Cavaliers' 15-game winning streak, marking the Cavaliers' first loss of the season with a thrilling 120-117 victory. Jayson Tatum shone for the Celtics, scoring 33 points, grabbing 12 rebounds, and contributing seven assists, while the team hit 22 three-pointers. Despite the Celtics ramping up the lead to 21 points, the Cavaliers rallied back, spurred by Donovan Mitchell's 35 points and Evan Mobleyâ€™s 22 points and 11 rebounds. Mitchell made a significant impact with a three-pointer late in the game, but his efforts were ultimately not enough to overtake Boston. The Celtics secured their third consecutive win with strong performances in pivotal moments, notably scoring 19 of the last 26 second-quarter points to establish a substantial halftime lead. The Cavaliers' strong start made them only the fourth NBA team to achieve a 15-game unbeaten run at the season's outset, marking a franchise record; however, the Celtics highlighted their championship caliber, holding on to a narrow victory against the then top Eastern Conference team.
