**Detroit Pistons 109 - 115 Indiana Pacers**  
The Indiana Pacers rallied to beat the Detroit Pistons 115-109 in a thrilling season opener, spoiling J.B. Bickerstaff's debut as the Pistons' coach. Despite trailing by 12 points and being behind after each of the first three quarters in a game that featured 13 lead changes and four ties, the Pacers surged in the fourth quarter. They overcame an eight-point deficit by outscoring the Pistons 33-19, thanks in part to Myles Turner’s 20 points and strong performances from Pascal Siakam and Bennedict Mathurin, who each contributed 19 points. Detroit's Cade Cunningham shone with 28 points, 22 of which were scored in the second half, but it wasn't enough to secure a win for a team that has struggled in recent seasons. The game was marked by an overturned call with 6:31 left that shifted momentum toward Indiana. The Pacers' defense tightened in the final quarter, limiting the Pistons to just 5 of 20 shooting. Both teams are set to continue their early-season campaigns on the road, with Indiana facing the New York Knicks and Detroit heading to Cleveland.
