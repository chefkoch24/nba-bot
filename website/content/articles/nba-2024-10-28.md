**Indiana Pacers 114 - 118 Philadelphia 76ers**  
Tyrese Maxey delivered an impressive performance for the Philadelphia 76ers, scoring a season-high 45 points, including 10 of the team's 13 points in overtime, leading them to a 118-114 victory over the Indiana Pacers for their first win of the season. Maxey was pivotal in the second half, overcoming a 102-97 deficit in regulation's final minute. Supporting Maxey's effort, Caleb Martin contributed 17 points and 12 rebounds, while Andre Drummond grabbed 17 rebounds. The Pacersâ€™ Tyrese Haliburton, recovering from a scoreless night against New York, scored 22 points, including a last-second three-pointer to force overtime, but his missed free throws in overtime were costly. With Joel Embiid and Paul George sidelined due to injuries, Maxey's standout performance was crucial in preventing the 76ers from starting 0-3. Indiana struggled with shooting, going 23 of 34 from the free-throw line, and was significantly outrebounded 54-37, particularly on the offensive end.

Rookie Donovan Clingan made a noteworthy impact, blocking Williamson twice, contributing to his early shooting woes. Meanwhile, Portland's Deni Avdija had a rough shooting performance, going 5 for 21 over the back-to-back games, though coach Chauncey Billups expressed an ongoing effort to integrate him effectively into the team's play.
