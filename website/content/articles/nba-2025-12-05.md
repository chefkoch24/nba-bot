**Philadelphia 76ers 99 - 98 Golden State Warriors**  
In a thrilling finish, the Philadelphia 76ers narrowly defeated the short-handed Golden State Warriors 99-98, thanks to a clutch follow shot by rookie VJ Edgecombe with just 0.9 seconds remaining. Tyrese Maxey was the standout performer for the 76ers, scoring 35 points and securing a game-saving block against De’Anthony Melton to seal the victory. The Warriors, missing key players Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler due to injuries, as well as losing Draymond Green mid-game, impressively erased a 24-point deficit and even took a late lead. Despite missing significant players like Curry and Butler, Golden State saw promising moments, including Pat Spencer's 16 points and Melton's strong season debut with 14 points after returning from an ACL injury. Joel Embiid contributed 12 points in his return for the 76ers, who will face Milwaukee the following night. The Warriors will next play in Cleveland on Saturday.

In a thrilling game, Lauri Markkanen led the Utah Jazz with a standout 30-point performance as they surged in the fourth quarter to defeat the Brooklyn Nets 123-110.

The Nets' Noah Clowney also impressed with 29 points, and Ziaire Williams contributed 23 off the bench, but their efforts fell short as they saw their two-game winning streak come to an end. With the game tied at 98 with just over six minutes left, George's clutch back-to-back 3-pointers helped shift the momentum. The Jazz were without the Nets' leading scorer, Michael Porter Jr., who rested due to injury management. Utah stays in New York to face the Knicks next, while the Nets prepare to host the Pelicans.
