The Colorado Avalanche secured a dominant 5-1 victory over the Ottawa Senators, thanks to Brock Nelson, who scored his first two goals for the Avalanche since being traded from the New York Islanders. The Avalanche took control early, netting four goals in the first period, which included a noteworthy goal from Nathan MacKinnon and another from defenseman Cale Makar, who became the eighth defenseman in NHL history to achieve three 80-point seasons before turning 27. This victory marked their ninth win in eleven games, pulling them within three points of the Dallas Stars in the Central Division standings. Despite a fast start from Ottawa, with Senators' goalie Linus Ullmark allowing four goals on 13 shots before being replaced, Colorado's Scott Wedgewood made 15 saves, maintaining his five-game winning streak. MacKinnon also marked his 200th consecutive NHL game, showcasing the depth and resilience of the Avalanche team, even on the back end of a back-to-back situation.

**Columbus Blue Jackets 0 - 1 Florida Panthers**  
Barkov lifts Panthers past Blue Jackets in OT
 **COLUMBUS** \-\- <forge-entity title="Aleksander Barkov" slug="aleksander-barkov-8477493" code="player">Aleksander Barkov</forge-entity> scored a power-play goal 29 seconds into overtime, giving the Florida Panthers a 1-0 win against the Columbus Blue Jackets at Nationwide Arena on Thursday. 
He scored from the top of the slot after Blue Jackets forward <forge-entity title="Kirill Marchenko" slug="kirill-marchenko-8480893" code="player">Kirill Marchenko</forge-entity> was called for delay of game at 19:30 of the third period when he put the puck over the glass. 
<forge-entity title="Sergei Bobrovsky" slug="sergei-bobrovsky-8475683" code="player">Sergei Bobrovsky</forge-entity> made 25 saves in his fifth shutout of the season for the Panthers (42-24-3), who had lost two straight and three of four. Florida remained tied with the Toronto Maple Leafs for first place in the Atlantic Division, two points ahead of the Tampa Bay Lightning.

“It was a great game. It was a playoff-style game,” Bobrovsky said. “Opponent played hard. Opponent played a good game, but we worked hard. We had a great focus, great concentration. We were together. We were tight and we just grinded \[it\] out. It’s big points for us.”

<forge-entity title="Elvis Merzlikins" slug="elvis-merzlikins-8478007" code="player">Elvis Merzlikins</forge-entity> made 27 saves for the Blue Jackets (31-28-9), who have lost five straight, including three by shutout. They also have lost seven of eight, getting shut out four times in that span.

“We didn't get the final bounce. They did,” Columbus forward <forge-entity title="Sean Kuraly" slug="sean-kuraly-8476374" code="player">Sean Kuraly</forge-entity> said. “That's the way it goes.”

The Blue Jackets remained three points behind the Montreal Canadiens for the second wild card into the Stanley Cup Playoffs from the Eastern Conference.

“Are we trending in the right direction? A hundred percent,” Columbus coach Dean Evason said. “We're not happy in the dressing room. There's no, ‘Oh, good. We played great against the Stanley Cup champions.’ No way. We're \[mad\]. But did we do the right things to get a point? Did we catch a bad break trying to do the right thing? Yeah, so we're real positive after we're \[mad\].”

Barkov said the Panthers know they will be playing desperate teams down the stretch.

“We talked about it before the game, that we're also in the battle,” the Florida captain said. “So, it's not over for us at all. We need to get there (to the playoffs) as well, and we need to change the mindset a little bit so that we need to win games as well and battle for the playoffs as well. So, I think it was we were desperate today, and we wanted to win and we got the win.”

<forge-entity title="Boone Jenner" slug="boone-jenner-8476432" code="player">Boone Jenner</forge-entity> had a goal overturned for Columbus at 10:14 of the third after video review determined he kicked the puck into the net.

“We're getting chances. They weren't going,” said Jenner, the Blue Jackets captain. “It’s on us to get those breaks going our way. Elvis was outstanding all night. We're honing in on some details that we need to hone in on at this time of the season.”

Bobrovsky has 49 NHL shutouts after getting his fourth against his former team. He made 16 saves in a 3-0 home win against Columbus on March 6. 
The Blue Jackets scored once during their four-game homestand. That included consecutive 4-0 losses, against the Vegas Golden Knights (March 13) and New York Rangers (March 15). <forge-entity title="Mathieu Olivier" slug="mathieu-olivier-8479671" code="player">Mathieu Olivier</forge-entity> scored in the third period of a 2-1 loss to the New Jersey Devils on Monday.

“We are battling for every single puck, every single shift,” Merzlikins said. “We really want to do something nice this year.”

At 8:02 of the third period, Florida’s <forge-entity title="Gustav Forsling" slug="gustav-forsling-8478055" code="player">Gustav Forsling</forge-entity> put a slap shot off the crossbar.

Merzlikins kept it 0-0 with four seconds left in the third when he stopped <forge-entity title="Mackie Samoskevich" slug="mackie-samoskevich-8482713" code="player">Mackie Samoskevich</forge-entity>’s wrist shot from the left face-off circle with the Panthers on the power play.

“I like the fact that we've been able to play in tight games,” Florida coach Paul Maurice said. “I've been saying that for two months. I think even in the two we lost last week (3-2 at Boston Bruins on March 11; 3-1 at Montreal on Saturday), they're pretty tight in the third, so to come out with a win after losing two is important.”

**NOTES**: It was Bobrovsky’s third straight shutout against the Blue Jackets dating to April 11, 2024. Only two goaltenders in the NHL’s modern era (since 1943-44) have had a longer run against one franchise: <forge-entity title="Dominik Hasek" slug="dominik-hasek-8447687" code="player">Dominik Hasek</forge-entity> (four games against the Rangers from Dec. 21, 1997 to Oct. 27, 1998) and Glenn Hall (four games against the Bruins from Jan. 8, 1953 to Dec. 3, 1955). … With his 10th career overtime goal, Barkov tied Olli Jokinen for the most in Panthers history. … Columbus is 0-6-2 in its past eight games against Florida and 3-13-4 against the Panthers in the past five seasons.

**Dallas Stars 2 - 3 Tampa Bay Lightning**  
The Tampa Bay Lightning secured their third consecutive win by defeating the Dallas Stars 3-2 in a shootout at the American Airlines Center. Brandon Hagel and Anthony Cirelli each contributed a goal and an assist for the Lightning, with Gage Goncalves netting the decisive goal in the fourth round of the shootout.

The game was marked by a playoff-like intensity, as noted by both teams, with Dallas' inability to match Tampa Bay's physicality and hunger noted by their coach, Pete DeBoer. Hagel set an NHL record for the most goals in a season without a power-play goal, surpassing Doug Smail's 1984-85 record.

The Kings' decisive first period saw them outshooting the Blackhawks 19-7, a stark contrast to their previous struggles against Chicago, including a shootout loss and a 5-1 defeat earlier. Meanwhile, Connor Bedard scored the lone goal for the Blackhawks, who continue to struggle with a record of 0-5-1 in their last six games.

Additionally, Blackhawks forward Colton Dach was sidelined late in the third period due to an upper-body injury.

**Edmonton Oilers 3 - 4 Winnipeg Jets**  
Kyle Connor's overtime goal lifted the Winnipeg Jets to a 4-3 victory over the short-handed Edmonton Oilers, playing at Rogers Place. In a game where both teams faced significant challenges, Connor scored 1:13 into overtime with a wrist shot past Oilers backup goalie Calvin Pickard, who had just entered the game due to Stuart Skinner's departure for concussion protocol. The Oilers were missing their star players, as Connor McDavid exited with a lower-body injury and Leon Draisaitl was already sidelined. Despite these absences, Jeff Skinner managed to contribute two goals for Edmonton. On the Jets' side, Connor Hellebuyck made 21 saves, securing his 40th win of the season, a milestone achieved by only one other U.S.-born goaltender, Ryan Miller.
