**Los Angeles Lakers 125 - 109 San Antonio Spurs**  
In a decisive 125-109 victory over the San Antonio Spurs, the Los Angeles Lakers were led by Austin Reaves, who scored 30 points and contributed seven rebounds and six assists, hitting five 3-pointers. Luka Doncic added 21 points, 14 assists, and nine rebounds, despite a tough shooting night at 5-for-20. The win marked the Lakers' eighth consecutive home victory, as they maintained balanced scoring despite LeBron James missing his fifth game. Bronny James thrilled fans with a late 3-pointer during his two minutes of play. The game, rescheduled due to Southern California wildfires, saw Dorian Finney-Smith and Stephon Castle also score in double digits, while a scuffle led to the ejection of Jarred Vanderbilt and Jeremy Sochan. Reaves has been stellar in James' absence, scoring at least 28 points in each of the last four games, matching his output across the Lakers' first 63 games. The Spurs, struggling defensively without De'Aaron Fox, fell short despite a 15-0 run in the third quarter, and are set to host the Knicks next, while the Lakers will face the Nuggets.

**New York Knicks 116 - 95 Miami Heat**  
The New York Knicks mounted a third-quarter surge to defeat the Miami Heat 116-95, extending Miami's losing streak to eight games under coach Erik Spoelstra for the first time. Mikal Bridges led the Knicks with 28 points, while Josh Hart recorded his eighth triple-double of the season, tying a franchise record originally set by Hall of Famer Walt Frazier. Despite an early 12-0 deficit, Karl-Anthony Towns' 15 consecutive points in the second quarter turned the game around, helping the Knicks complete a season sweep of Miami for the first time since 1992-93. An unusual courtside incident involving Tracy Morgan temporarily halted the game, but it was after this delay that the Knicks outscored the Heat 24-6 to extend their lead to 88-64. Miami's Duncan Robinson scored 22 points, but it was not enough as the team squandered a double-digit lead for the 18th time this season. The Heat aim to break their slump against Detroit at the start of a five-game homestand, while the Knicks head to San Antonio next.

Jalen Green and Jabari Smith Jr. each scored 30 points for the Rockets, who tied the game with a late 10-2 run in the fourth quarter. Alperen Sengun's crucial put-back with 3.1 seconds left in regulation forced overtime, where Houston established a six-point lead with a 9-3 run. Despite Quentin Grimes' impressive career-high 46 points and eight 3-pointers for Philadelphia, which helped the team tie their franchise record with 24 successful threes, the Rockets secured victory with clutch free throws from Sengun and Aaron Holiday. Both teams combined for a remarkable 46 3-pointers, with Houston setting a season-high of 22. The Rockets displayed the need for more consistent play after their early struggles, while Grimes continued to shine for an injury-hit 76ers squad.

**Minnesota Timberwolves 130 - 132 Indiana Pacers**  
In a thrilling contest, Obi Toppin's last-second three-pointer secured a narrow 132-130 overtime victory for the depleted Indiana Pacers over the Minnesota Timberwolves, ending the Timberwolves’ eight-game winning streak. Toppin scored a season-high 34 points, including the decisive shot with 3.5 seconds remaining, despite Indiana lacking its top six scorers and four starters. T.J. McConnell contributed significantly with 11 points, 13 assists, and a critical layup that tied the game in regulation. Despite Anthony Edwards' 38 points for Minnesota, his team struggled, particularly with his 1-for-11 shooting from beyond the arc. The game was marred by Andrew Nembhard's ejection for clashing with Rudy Gobert, adding tension to an already intense matchup. This win positions Indiana just behind Milwaukee in the Eastern Conference, while Minnesota faces challenges as it seeks a playoff berth, dealing with back-to-back games and playing against determined yet shorthanded teams.

**New Orleans Pelicans 81 - 127 Detroit Pistons**  
The Detroit Pistons delivered an emphatic 127-81 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans, fueled by Cade Cunningham's 24 points and eight assists. Simone Fontecchio contributed 23 points in an efficient performance, going 5-for-5 from three-point range and 9-for-10 overall from the field. The Pistons seized control early with a 24-5 run, leading to a commanding 63-32 halftime lead. Despite Zion Williamson's 30-point effort for the Pelicans, New Orleans struggled with just a 32.6% field goal percentage and 5-for-32 from beyond the arc. The night also brought bad news for the Pelicans with Trey Murphy III ruled out for the season due to a shoulder injury sustained during the game. The Pistons took advantage of the Pelicans' struggles, dominating with a 50-39 rebounding edge, thanks in part to contributions from Jalen Duren. Detroit will face the Miami Heat next, while the Pelicans head to a doubleheader against the Minnesota Timberwolves.

**Phoenix Suns 129 - 89 Toronto Raptors**  
The Phoenix Suns, propelled by Devin Booker's 27 points, dominated the Toronto Raptors 129-89, achieving a 40-point victory margin, which was their largest lead of the night. Despite missing injured guard Bradley Beal, the Suns saw strong contributions from their bench, with seven players scoring in double figures. Phoenix overcame a first-quarter deficit by outscoring Toronto 39-11 in the second quarter, largely due to notable performances from reserves such as Royce O’Neale, Tyus Jones, Cody Martin, and Oso Ighodaro. The Raptors, playing without several key starters, struggled against the Suns' depth. Booker's 13 points in a 15-2 run early in the second quarter set the tone for the game. Despite this loss, the Suns moved closer to a play-in spot in the Western Conference.
