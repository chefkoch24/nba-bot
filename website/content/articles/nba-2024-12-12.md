The Atlanta Hawks continued their impressive NBA Cup run by defeating the New York Knicks 108-100, advancing to the semifinals in Las Vegas. Trae Young led the Hawks with 22 points and 11 assists, while De'Andre Hunter and Jalen Johnson significantly contributed with 24 points and 21 points respectively, with Johnson adding 15 rebounds and seven assists.

For the Knicks, Josh Hart and Karl-Anthony Towns made strong efforts with 21 and 19 points, respectively, but couldn't maintain their early advantage. This marks another memorable performance at Madison Square Garden for Young, recalling his 2021 playoffs victory celebration.

**Houston Rockets 91 - 90 Golden State Warriors**  
The Houston Rockets advanced to the NBA Cup semifinals by defeating the Los Angeles Clippers 117-106, despite being without their key veteran guard Fred VanVleet due to a knee injury. VanVleet, who averages 16 points and leads the team in assists with 5.9 per game, is expected to return for the quarterfinal matchup against the Golden State Warriors. With VanVleet sidelined, the Rockets effectively ran their offense through Alperen Sengun, Jalen Green, and Amen Thompson, with Green leading all scorers with 31 points. Coach Ime Udoka praised the team's adaptability, stating that it was crucial for players to step up in VanVleet's absence, a sentiment echoed by Green, who emphasized the importance of maintaining momentum. The Rockets face a formidable opponent in the Warriors, who have historically dominated their postseason encounters and recently returned Stephen Curry and Draymond Green to the lineup. The winner of this matchup will progress to the semifinals to face either Dallas or Oklahoma City, with the Warriors keen on making it to Las Vegas, as stated by Curry.
