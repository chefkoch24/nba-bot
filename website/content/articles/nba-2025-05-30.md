**New York Knicks 111 - 94 Indiana Pacers**  
In a thrilling Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals, the New York Knicks managed to keep their championship hopes alive by defeating the Indiana Pacers 111-94, forcing a Game 6. Jalen Brunson led the Knicks with 32 points, marking his 21st postseason game with 30 or more points, while Karl-Anthony Towns delivered a solid performance with 24 points and 13 rebounds despite playing with a bruised left knee. The win, New York's first on their home court in the series, denied the Pacers an early ticket to the NBA Finals, which would have been only their second in franchise history. The Knicks' defensive efforts were key, as they restricted the Pacers to a mere 45 points in the first half and limited Tyrese Haliburton's impact significantly. The Pacers struggled offensively, with a field goal percentage of just 40.5%, their lowest-scoring game in the postseason so far. Coach Rick Carlisle acknowledged the Knicks' dominant play and emphasized the need for Indiana to elevate their game in the next outing. New York hopes to become just the 14th team in NBA history to come back from a 3-1 series deficit, as they continue striving for their first conference finals advancement since 2000.
