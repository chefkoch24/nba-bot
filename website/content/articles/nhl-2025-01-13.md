**Ottawa Senators 3 - 2 Dallas Stars**  
The Ottawa Senators halted the Dallas Stars' seven-game winning streak with a 3-2 victory at Canadian Tire Centre, powered by Leevi Merilainen's standout performance of 24 saves. The young goalie notched his second win in consecutive days, coming off his first NHL shutout against the Pittsburgh Penguins. Ottawa staged a comeback after Jason Robertson gave Dallas an early lead, with Josh Norris and Tim Stutzle scoring in quick succession in the second period. Despite a disallowed goal due to an offside call, the Stars couldn't recover, even after a late power-play goal from Evgenii Dadonov. Matthew Highmore's third-period goal, his first since April 2022, provided the Senators with a decisive lead. Ottawa's win also extended the Stars' losing streak in Ottawa to eight games, as they haven't claimed a victory there since March 2016.

**Pittsburgh Penguins 2 - 5 Tampa Bay Lightning**  
In a dynamic matchup, the Tampa Bay Lightning triumphed over the Pittsburgh Penguins with a 5-2 victory, highlighted by Nikita Kucherov's standout performance. Kucherov notched two goals and an assist, including a pivotal go-ahead goal late in the third period, contributing to Tampa Bay's success. Anthony Cirelli and Nick Paul capitalized on empty-net opportunities to secure the win. The game saw Brandon Hagel and Jake Guentzel each record two points, while Jonas Johansson made 31 saves for the Lightning. The Penguins showed signs of resilience with Rickard Rakell and Kevin Hayes scoring, but struggled to capitalize on their early dominance, ultimately suffering their sixth loss in seven games. Notably, multiple Tampa players, including Brayden Point and Kucherov, reached the 20-goal milestone this season. Pittsburgh's efforts were hindered as Evgeni Malkin remained on injured reserve, and Michael Bunting was involved in a pre-game auto accident, although not seriously hurt.

**Carolina Hurricanes 2 - 3 Anaheim Ducks**  
In an exciting matchup, the Anaheim Ducks defeated the Carolina Hurricanes 3-2 in overtime, led by Cutter Gauthier's standout performance as he scored his first two-goal game in the NHL, including the game-winning goal just 1:52 into overtime. Gauthier showcased impressive play by carrying the puck from his blue line before scoring on a wrist shot. His decisive goal was influenced by a dinner conversation with Ducks' goalie John Gibson, who advised him to target the five-hole. Despite facing a two-goal deficit, the Hurricanes responded with Seth Jarvis tying the game with just 56 seconds left in regulation and Andrei Svechnikov scoring on a power-play, breaking Carolina's 0-for-17 power-play drought in six games. Ducks' goalie Lukas Dostal was instrumental in the victory, making 35 saves, while Jansen Harkins registered his first goal for Anaheim. The game was also highlighted by a strong performance from Isac Lundestrom, successful in most face-offs, and the return of Hurricanes' Shayne Gostisbehere after injury.

Adin Hill recorded 15 saves, while Minnesotaâ€™s Ryan Hartman scored the Wild's lone goal. Vegas coach Bruce Cassidy underscored Dorofeyev's streaky scoring potential and praised the team's ability to rebound from recent setbacks.
