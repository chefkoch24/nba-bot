**Indiana Pacers 108 - 96 Golden State Warriors**  
In a matchup against the Golden State Warriors, the Indiana Pacers showcased strong performances from Tyrese Haliburton and Pascal Siakam, both scoring 25 points in their 108-96 victory. Haliburton added 10 assists while Siakam collected 10 rebounds, propelling the Pacers to their fifth consecutive win, tying their longest winning streak of the season. The Warriors, playing without several key players including Stephen Curry and Draymond Green due to injuries, were led by Buddy Hield and Pat Spencer, who each scored 17 points. Indiana seized control with a decisive 17-2 run in the second quarter, transforming a one-point deficit into a substantial lead that Golden State could not overcome. Despite the Warriors' persistence and the contributions of local talent Trayce Jackson-Davis, the Pacers maintained their advantage with key three-pointers from Haliburton and Bennedict Mathurin. As the Pacers head to Cleveland and the Warriors continue their road trip in Toronto, Indiana builds on its momentum with improved All-Star performances and depth.

**Orlando Magic 106 - 109 Milwaukee Bucks**  
In a thrilling game in Orlando, Giannis Antetokounmpo powered the Milwaukee Bucks to a narrow 109-106 victory over the Magic, scoring 41 points and grabbing 14 rebounds. Despite the Magic star Paolo Banchero's impressive return from injury with 34 points, seven rebounds, and three assists, the Bucks managed to seal the win, bolstered by Damian Lillard's 29 points, including crucial free throws with just 9.3 seconds on the clock. Banchero, playing for the first time since suffering a torn right oblique, shot 5 of 8 from beyond the arc, marking a strong comeback. Cole Anthony and Tristan da Silva also contributed significantly for the Magic, although their effort wasn't enough to overcome Milwaukee's performance. The Bucks, now level with Orlando for fourth place in the East, overcame shaky moments and poor free-throw shooting, with Antetokounmpo missing seven from the line, to secure their third consecutive win.

**Philadelphia 76ers 115 - 123 New Orleans Pelicans**  
CJ McCollum excelled with 38 points, leading the New Orleans Pelicans to a 123-115 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers despite the absence of suspended Zion Williamson and injured Herb Jones. Williamson's suspension was due to repeated lateness, while Jones is out with a shoulder injury. The 76ers were without their All-Star center Joel Embiid, who missed his third consecutive game and has been absent 23 times this season, with the team struggling at 8-15 without him. Tyrese Maxey shone for the Sixers with 30 points and 12 assists, while Paul George added 25 points and 11 rebounds. Jordan Hawkins contributed 21 points for the Pelicans, who snapped a two-game losing streak and captured only their third win since December 7. Significant performances included McCollum's pivotal three-pointers and his decisive step-back jumper to secure the victory. The Pelicans next face Boston, and the 76ers travel to Orlando.

**Boston Celtics 97 - 114 Sacramento Kings**  
The Sacramento Kings secured their sixth consecutive victory by defeating the Boston Celtics 114-97, thanks in large part to Domantas Sabonis's standout performance with 23 points and a career-high 28 rebounds.

The game was tightly contested up to the third quarter, tied at 76, before the Kings surged ahead with a dominant 24-9 run in the fourth quarter. The Kings excelled in the paint, outscoring the Celtics 48-40, and held a substantial 56-43 advantage in rebounds despite missing De’Aaron Fox due to injury. DeMar DeRozan and Malik Monk contributed significantly with 24 and 22 points, respectively. Meanwhile, Jaylen Brown led Boston with 28 points, and Jayson Tatum, despite achieving a double-double, committed a season-high eight turnovers for the Celtics, who have now lost two of their last three games.

The Oklahoma City Thunder, led by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander with 39 points in just 29 minutes, rebounded impressively to defeat the New York Knicks 126-101 at Madison Square Garden. This performance came after the Thunder's 15-game winning streak was halted by a loss to Cleveland.

The game was decided early with Oklahoma City's dominant plays, including a 36-12 run in the first half and a 12-0 spurt to close the first quarter. Despite Jalen Brunson and Karl-Anthony Towns scoring 27 and 23 points respectively, the Knicks faced another setback, marking their fourth loss in five games. The game saw the Thunder decisively outscore the Knicks 68-36 over consecutive quarters from last Friday's game to this one, showcasing their offensive potency.

**Chicago Bulls 138 - 105 Washington Wizards**  
In a commanding performance, Zach LaVine led the Chicago Bulls with 33 points to secure a 138-105 victory over the Washington Wizards at home. Nikola Vučević contributed significantly with 23 points and 13 rebounds, while Coby White and Jalen Smith each added 15 points, propelling the Bulls to their fifth win in seven games and avenging a previous loss to Washington. Jordan Poole, returning from a hip contusion, was the top scorer for the Wizards with 22 points, but his contribution dwindled after halftime. Chicago's decisive plays, including a 9-0 run in the third quarter and sharp shooting from beyond the arc, especially Vučević’s three successful 3-pointers, were pivotal in maintaining a double-digit lead until the end. Despite missing Ayo Dosunmu, the Bulls executed effectively against the struggling Wizards, who now hold an NBA-worst record of 6-30.

**Denver Nuggets 124 - 105 Brooklyn Nets**  
In a dominant display, Nikola Jokic and Russell Westbrook both secured triple-doubles to lead the Denver Nuggets to a 124-105 victory over the Brooklyn Nets. Jokic, returning after missing two games due to illness, delivered 35 points, 15 assists, and 12 rebounds, marking his 145th career triple-double. Meanwhile, Westbrook had 25 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists, achieving his 202nd career triple-double. This game marked the second time this season that Jokic and Westbrook recorded triple-doubles simultaneously, making them the first teammates in NBA history to achieve this feat multiple times in a single season. Despite Ben Simmons' return for Brooklyn, adding 10 points and six assists, the struggling Nets couldn't overcome Denver's powerful second-half burst. The Nuggets capitalized on a significant late-second-quarter run and minimized turnovers to maintain their advantage over the Nets, who are on a tough losing streak.
