**Oklahoma City Thunder 110 - 111 Indiana Pacers**  
In an exhilarating path to the NBA Finals, the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Indiana Pacers prepare for a historic showdown as both teams aim for their first-ever NBA title. The narrative is enriched by their connections through Paul George, whose trades have shaped their current rosters. The Thunder, steered by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the season's leading scorer and MVP, had a dominant 68-14 regular season and have been defensively formidable with a top-ranked 104.7 defensive rating in the playoffs. Meanwhile, the Pacers, who experienced a rocky start to their season, surged to prominence, defeating top playoff contenders on their way to the finals, primarily driven by Tyrese Haliburton's critical role. Despite the Thunder sweeping their regular-season encounters, the finals promise an intriguing contest between Oklahoma City's resolute defense and Indiana's potent offense. Both teams are overcoming obstacles, with the Pacers even facing travel hurdles due to weather, underlining their resilience.
