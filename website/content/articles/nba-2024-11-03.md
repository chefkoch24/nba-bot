**Charlotte Hornets 103 - 113 Boston Celtics**  
The Boston Celtics secured a second consecutive victory over the Charlotte Hornets at the Spectrum Center, winning 113-103 on Saturday. Jayson Tatum led the Celtics with 29 points despite struggling from beyond the arc, while Payton Pritchard added 22 points, making six 3-pointers. Derrick White contributed with 18 points and eight rebounds, filling in effectively as Jaylen Brown sat out due to a hip flexor strain. Charlotte's LaMelo Ball shone with 36 points but fouled out for the second game in a row, impacting the Hornets' performance. Despite Brandon Miller's return with 16 points, Charlotte struggled without key centers Mark Williams and Nick Richards, losing the rebounding battle 44-34. A strong Celtics defense and timely 3-pointer from Jrue Holiday helped maintain their lead, while Boston improved to a 6-1 record. The game featured less drama compared to the previous night, notably missing any incidents similar to Grant Williams’ flagrant-two foul.

RJ Barrett led the Raptors with 31 points, while Chris Boucher added a season-high 24 points.

The Raptors also retired Vince Carter's No. 15 jersey at halftime. Notably, Toronto hit a season-high 17 three-pointers and secured their first win since losing Scottie Barnes to injury.

**Milwaukee Bucks 113 - 114 Cleveland Cavaliers**  
The Cleveland Cavaliers remained undefeated and improved to 7-0 with a thrilling 114-113 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks, thanks to Donovan Mitchell's 30-point performance, including a last-second jumper. This win puts Cleveland just one game away from matching their franchise-best start of eight consecutive wins set in the 1976-77 season. Despite the Bucks losing their fifth straight game after an opening win, Damian Lillard's standout performance with 41 points and 10-of-15 shooting from three-point range wasn't enough to secure a victory. Giannis Antetokounmpo contributed 34 points, 16 rebounds, and nine assists, but the Bucks were hindered by Khris Middleton's absence due to ankle surgery recovery. The Cavaliers showed resilience, securing a win without Caris LeVert, who was sidelined with a sore knee. Although the Bucks had a strong start from beyond the arc, their efforts faltered as Lillard and Antetokounmpo lacked additional support, notably from Gary Trent Jr., who scored only three points in 34 minutes. The teams will face off again on Monday in Cleveland.

**San Antonio Spurs 113 - 103 Minnesota Timberwolves**  
In a surprising victory, the San Antonio Spurs triumphed over the Minnesota Timberwolves 113-103 despite the absence of their coach Gregg Popovich due to illness. Keldon Johnson led the Spurs with 25 points, while Chris Paul showcased his veteran skills with 15 points and 13 assists, marking his second consecutive game with at least 10 assists, making him the second-oldest in NBA history after John Stockton to do so. San Antonio’s rising talent, Victor Wembanyama, added 17 points and crucial defensive stops, including blocking Rudy Gobert twice in a defensive showcase that helped the Spurs maintain a slim lead just before halftime. The Timberwolves, coming off a late-night win over Denver, saw Julius Randle and Anthony Edwards score 21 and 18 points respectively but struggled against the fresh Spurs defense, committing crucial turnovers that San Antonio capitalized on. San Antonio, having tightened up its game with a notable reduction in turnovers from earlier in the season, now looks forward to facing the Los Angeles Clippers, while Minnesota prepares to host the Charlotte Hornets.

Notably, Jaime Jaquez Jr. made his debut in his father's homeland, scoring eight points, while Washington's Bilal Coulibaly continued his scoring streak with 22 points. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver announced plans for more games in Mexico, highlighting the league's expansion efforts.

They committed 24 turnovers which the Nuggets exploited, turning them into 39 points. Utah showed resilience by recovering from an early deficit to tie the game in the second quarter, but Denver took control with a pivotal 14-0 run before halftime and extended their lead in the third quarter, outscoring the Jazz 34-19.

Despite trailing significantly, Portland rallied in the final quarter, narrowing the gap to two points in the last minute, but Booker and Tyus Jones secured the win with crucial free throws. Anfernee Simons and Jerami Grant led Portland with 20 points each, while former Sun Deandre Ayton had a double-double with 10 points and 13 rebounds. Bradley Beal, returning from injury, played a significant role with 15 points, seven rebounds, and four assists. The Suns will face the 76ers next, while the Trail Blazers head to New Orleans.

**LA Clippers 92 - 105 Oklahoma City Thunder**  
The Oklahoma City Thunder maintained their perfect start to the season with a 105-92 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers in Inglewood, Calif., marking their best beginning to a season since relocating from Seattle in 2008. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led with 25 points, while all Thunder starters scored in double figures. Despite Norman Powell's 24 points and James Harden's 12 points and 13 rebounds for the Clippers, Los Angeles remains winless in their new arena, having blown double-digit leads in each game. The Clippers excelled in the first quarter with eight three-pointers but faltered to just a 3 for 16 performance for the rest of the match. Gilgeous-Alexander was particularly impressive, scoring 23 points across the second and third quarters, possibly staking his claim in an MVP race. As they head into their next games, the Thunder will host Orlando, and the Clippers will face San Antonio.
