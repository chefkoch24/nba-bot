**Miami Heat 87 - 124 Cleveland Cavaliers**  
The Cleveland Cavaliers dominated the Miami Heat to secure a 3-0 lead in their Eastern Conference first-round series with a 124-87 victory, despite Donovan Mitchell's off shooting night and the absence of injured Darius Garland. Jarrett Allen and De’Andre Hunter led the scoring with 22 and 21 points respectively, as Cleveland outmuscled Miami, outrebounding them 46-29 and outscoring them 60-30 in the paint. The Cavs took control with an impressive 33-5 run early and never looked back, even as Miami tried to rally. Evan Mobley added 19 points, while Ty Jerome contributed 13 points and 11 assists in a strong performance. Miami, which suffered its worst playoff defeat, had Bam Adebayo score 22 but fell short, and with this significant loss, they are now facing the threat of being swept. Historically, Cleveland has won every series when leading 3-0, all previously occurring in the LeBron James era, and they will aim for a series sweep in Game 4. Miami had a chance to bounce back but couldn't capitalize during a slow start for the Cavs in the second half, which ultimately sealed their fate in this matchup.
