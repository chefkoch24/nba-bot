**Orlando Magic 117 - 108 Miami Heat**  
The Orlando Magic secured a 117-108 victory over the Miami Heat, advancing to the NBA Cup semifinals, driven by Desmond Bane's stellar performance matching his season high with 37 points. Despite Miami's early 15-0 lead fueled by Tyler Herro, the Magic staged a comeback, with Bane's critical scoring in the fourth quarter establishing a solid lead. Jalen Suggs and Paolo Banchero supported with 20 and 18 points respectively. The Heat's struggle from beyond the arc was evident as they hit just 24.2% of their 3-pointers, with Herro missing all six attempts. Notably, this game marked the Magic's first of the season without Franz Wagner due to a high ankle sprain. Miami, led by Norman Powell with 21 points, has now faced three defeats in Orlando this season. The Magic now move on to face the New York Knicks in Las Vegas, while the Heat prepare to host Toronto.

**Toronto Raptors 101 - 117 New York Knicks**  
The New York Knicks advanced to the NBA Cup semifinals for the first time by defeating the Toronto Raptors 117-101, thanks to standout performances from Jalen Brunson, who scored 35 points, and Josh Hart with 21. Karl-Anthony Towns, returning from an injury, contributed 14 points and 16 rebounds. The Knicks, who had reached the quarterfinals three times but never progressed further, will face the Orlando Magic in the semifinals in Las Vegas. Toronto, despite an unbeaten group stage, struggled with this being their fourth consecutive home loss, partly due to key absences, including Immanuel Quickley and RJ Barrett. The Raptors fell behind after being outscored 34-13 in the second quarter, a pivotal period marked by their poor shooting performance. This victory also highlighted Brunson’s impressive 26-point first half, his best half of the season.
