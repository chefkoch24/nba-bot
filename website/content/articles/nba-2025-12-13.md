**Charlotte Hornets 126 - 129 Chicago Bulls**  
The Chicago Bulls ended their seven-game losing streak by rallying from a 13-point second-half deficit to defeat the Charlotte Hornets 129-126. Josh Giddey led the Bulls with 26 points, 11 assists, and seven rebounds, while Zach Collins contributed 16 points off the bench.

The Hornets, losing four of their last five games, were led by Kon Knueppel who achieved a career-high 33 points and nine assists, with Miles Bridges adding 32 points. A potential game-tying 3-pointer by Knueppel at the end was initially fouled by Collins, but the call was overturned upon review, awarding possession to the Bulls. Chicago overcame a strong 3-point shooting performance by Charlotte, who hit 16 threes on 43.2% shooting. The Bulls, in contrast, made 10 of 28 from beyond the arc. Josh Green made his season debut for Charlotte following offseason shoulder surgery. The Bulls next host the Pelicans, while the Hornets travel to Cleveland on Sunday.

**Washington Wizards 126 - 130 Cleveland Cavaliers**  
Donovan Mitchell's impressive performance, scoring 24 of his 48 points in the fourth quarter, was the catalyst for the Cleveland Cavaliers' 130-126 comeback victory over the Washington Wizards. Despite a poor collective shooting effort from beyond the arc, where they made just 15 of 53 attempts, Mitchell's timely shooting played a crucial role, including a three-pointer that tied the game and a decisive inside basket that secured the lead. With the Cavaliers ahead 124-122, Mitchell forced a key jump ball against a taller Marvin Bagley III, leading to Lonzo Ball gaining possession and hitting crucial free throws. The Cavaliers had a staggering 34 three-point attempts in the first half and led 62-60 despite their shooting woes. After falling behind by 17 points, Mitchell's early fourth-quarter surge rapidly reduced the deficit. Even after a brief exit due to a technical foul, Mitchell returned to steer Cleveland to victory, overshadowing notable performances by Bub Carrington and CJ McCollum for Washington.

Despite being outscored by double digits in the third quarter, Memphis couldn't maintain their lead, with Santi Aldama scoring 22 points and Morant adding 21 points and 10 assists. Cam Spencer's perfect six-for-six from beyond the arc gave him 20 points, but Memphis, which was generally successful against sub-.500 teams, couldn't hold off the surging Jazz.

**Golden State Warriors 120 - 127 Minnesota Timberwolves**  
The Minnesota Timberwolves spoiled Stephen Curry's anticipated return from a strained left quad as they faced off against the Golden State Warriors in San Francisco. Curry, who had tormented the Timberwolves with 30-plus point performances in their previous meetings, was reuniting his on-court rivalry with Anthony Edwards, who boasts four 40-point games in his last nine outings. A significant defensive factor for the Timberwolves this season has been rookie Jaylen Clark, who helped lead the team to a 15-7 record in his appearances, including a key unbeaten streak when playing 14 minutes or more. Meanwhile, Minnesota leaned on veteran Mike Conley, who commended Clark's influence and team spirit. For the Warriors, the home game was marred by Draymond Green's absence due to personal reasons and Al Horford's ongoing injury struggles. The Warriors also faced internal challenges with Jonathan Kuminga, who, despite his potential, was benched for underperformance, a decision head coach Steve Kerr defended, emphasizing the need for consistency to reach stardom.
