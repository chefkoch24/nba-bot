**San Antonio Spurs 105 - 116 Orlando Magic**  
In an exciting matchup, the Orlando Magic staged a late rally to defeat the San Antonio Spurs 116-105, marking their fifth win in seven games. Leading the charge for the Magic, Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner each contributed 24 points, with Banchero also grabbing 10 rebounds. The Magic, now 37-40, leapfrogged Atlanta to claim seventh place in the Eastern Conference standings. Despite a 9-0 run that gave San Antonio a lead early in the third quarter, the Spurs couldn't maintain their momentum, losing their fifth straight game despite Harrison Barnes' 24-point effort. Notably, Chris Paul played his 1,347th career game, surpassing Kobe Bryant for 15th in NBA history for games played, and, at nearly 40, remains one of the league's oldest active players. The Spurs remain mathematically eligible for the play-in tournament, although their prospects are dim with only seven games left in the regular season.

**Atlanta Hawks 113 - 127 Portland Trail Blazers**

Notably, the Trail Blazers outscored the Hawks 66-58 in the paint. This victory keeps Portland four games behind Sacramento for the final play-in spot, while Atlanta’s loss secured the Indiana Pacers a playoff berth.

The New York Knicks dominated the Philadelphia 76ers with a 105-91 victory, marking the Knicks' third consecutive win and handing the 76ers their ninth straight loss.

Landry Shamet added a season-high 20 points, hitting six 3-pointers, while Mitchell Robinson contributed a double-double with 14 points and 14 rebounds on his birthday. Despite numerous injuries and using their 52nd different starting lineup, the 76ers saw former Knicks guard Quentin Grimes contribute 26 points. The Knicks managed 19 turnovers, converting them into a fourth-quarter lead, thanks to Josh Hart's buzzer-beating basket. Meanwhile, the 76ers welcomed back Kyle Lowry from injury, although he went scoreless, and are anticipating Tyrese Maxey's return. The Knicks are set to face Cleveland, while the 76ers will take on Milwaukee next.

**Memphis Grizzlies 125 - 134 Golden State Warriors**  
In an electrifying performance, Stephen Curry scored 52 points, including 12 three-pointers, to lead the Golden State Warriors to a 134-125 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies. Curry's exceptional shooting matched his season-high with 12 threes, leaving fans and coach Steve Kerr in awe. The win propelled the Warriors into fifth place in the Western Conference, overtaking Memphis. Jimmy Butler contributed 27 points, while Draymond Green recorded a triple-double with 13 points, 10 rebounds, and 12 assists. Despite Ja Morant's impressive 36-point effort for Memphis, the Grizzlies suffered their third consecutive loss, now precariously close to the play-in line after being second in the conference just last month. The game also featured a crucial play by Brandin Podziemski, who tipped in a missed Curry shot to secure the lead in the final stretch. Having completed a 3-2 road trip, the Warriors now head to Los Angeles to face the Lakers, while the Grizzlies embark on a challenging road trip against Eastern Conference teams.

**Milwaukee Bucks 133 - 123 Phoenix Suns**  
Giannis Antetokounmpo led the Milwaukee Bucks to a 133-123 victory over the struggling and short-handed Phoenix Suns, ending Milwaukee’s four-game losing streak. The Bucks set a franchise record by shooting 68.9% from the field, surpassing their previous record from 1985. This win also marked a milestone for Bucks coach Doc Rivers, as he tied Phil Jackson for seventh place in NBA history with 1,155 regular-season wins. Despite strong performances from Phoenix's Devin Booker, who scored 39 points, and Grayson Allen with 23, the Suns suffered their fourth consecutive loss while missing key players like Kevin Durant, Bradley Beal, and Royce O’Neale due to injuries and illness. Notably, this game also marked the return of former Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer to Fiserv Forum since his departure, where he had previously led the team to a 2021 championship. With this victory, the Bucks moved closer to overtaking Indiana and Detroit in the Eastern Conference standings, while the Suns fell further behind in the Western Conference race.

**Denver Nuggets 130 - 131 Minnesota Timberwolves**  
In a heated matchup, the Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Detroit Pistons, with the game turning into a near-brawl in the second quarter after a foul on Naz Reid. This intensity sets the stage for their upcoming clash with the Denver Nuggets, as Minnesota aims to secure a playoff spot in the competitive Western Conference. Reid and Donte DiVincenzo were ejected and suspended for one game each due to their roles in the altercation, leaving them out of the Denver game. The Timberwolves, currently seventh in the standings, have beaten the Nuggets in their last five meetings, including three this season, largely thanks to Anthony Edwards' performance, who averages 30.7 points in these games. Meanwhile, the Nuggets, holding onto the third seed, hope to end this losing streak against Minnesota, viewing the game as more than just another matchup. Denver's Jamal Murray might return after missing a game due to a tight hamstring, while Nikola Jokic continues to excel in all statistical categories. With both teams needing wins for different reasons, this game promises to maintain the high-stakes, playoff-like atmosphere seen recently.
