**Philadelphia 76ers 102 - 100 Boston Celtics**  
In a thrilling game, the Philadelphia 76ers edged out the Boston Celtics 102-100, thanks to standout performances by Tyrese Maxey and Justin Edwards, who remarkably led the team with 22 points in Joel Embiid’s absence due to right knee soreness. Embiid has been struggling with injuries this season, missing five out of eleven games, including four due to left knee surgery recovery. Edwards almost had a perfect shooting night, connecting on 8 of 9 shots and sinking 5 of 6 from beyond the arc, with a crucial stretch of three consecutive three-pointers in just over a minute late in the game to help Philadelphia overcome an eight-point deficit. The decisive moment came when Kelly Oubre Jr. followed up an Edwards missed three-pointer, his only one of the night, with a go-ahead basket with 8.7 seconds left. Despite Jaylen Brown's 24-point effort, Boston fell short when Andre Drummond’s defense disrupted their final play. This was the third meeting between these two teams this season, with each team having one win in the previous encounters. The 76ers will next face the Detroit Pistons, while the Celtics are set to play the Memphis Grizzlies.

**Oklahoma City Thunder 126 - 102 Golden State Warriors**  
In a dominant performance, the Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Golden State Warriors 126-102, with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander leading the way by scoring 28 points in just three quarters. Rookie sensation Chet Holmgren delivered a flawless shooting display, contributing 23 points and 11 rebounds while not missing a single one of his nine field goal attempts, both three-pointers, and all free throws. Despite Stephen Curry's return from illness, he struggled offensively and defensively, tallying only 11 points on 4-for-13 shooting and committing his fifth foul early in the second half. Oklahoma City's defense excelled even without Lu Dort, highlighted by limiting the Warriors to their second-lowest score this season. With this victory, the Thunder extended their home unbeaten streak to 5-0 and maintained their position at the top of the league with an 11-1 record, while the Warriors fell to 1-6 on the road. The Thunder fans enjoyed a memorable moment when Draymond Green's technical foul allowed the team to further extend its lead.

**Utah Jazz 152 - 128 Indiana Pacers**  
In a high-scoring affair, the Utah Jazz dominated the Indiana Pacers 152-128, marking the highest point total in an NBA game this season. Lauri Markkanen led the way with an impressive 35 points, complemented by rookie Ace Bailey's 20 points, showcasing his versatile skills in just his second start. Svi Mykhailiuk also contributed 20 points for the Jazz. Despite the return of key players like Pascal Siakam and Aaron Nesmith, the Pacers, who were last season's Eastern Conference champions, continued their struggles, falling to 1-10, matching the worst start in franchise history. Although Indiana posted a season-best shooting percentage of 46.5%, they allowed Utah to shoot 55.4% and failed to maintain their early lead, as the Jazz capitalized on their defensive weaknesses. Amidst a string of injuries and a challenging season, Indiana's T.J. McConnell made his season debut but was limited to 11 minutes due to a hamstring injury. Utah outperformed Indiana on both ends, outrebounding them 45-35 and capitalizing on their interior defensive lapses to secure a decisive victory.

**Sacramento Kings 84 - 85 Denver Nuggets**  
Nikola Jokic continued his impressive start to the season with another stellar performance as the Denver Nuggets look to extend their winning streak against the Sacramento Kings on Tuesday night. Jokic, who has six triple-doubles in nine games this season, delivered a remarkable 32-point, 14-rebound, and 14-assist game in a recent victory over the Indiana Pacers, highlighting his efficiency by hitting 10 of 14 shots and almost perfect free-throw shooting. Nuggets coach David Adelman praised Jokic as the most efficient player he's ever seen. Despite the absence of key players Jamal Murray and Aaron Gordon due to injuries, the Nuggets secured their fourth consecutive win. As Denver embarks on a road trip, the Kings, led by Domantas Sabonis, who recently returned from a rib injury, are struggling defensively. They've lost three of their last four games, including a 144-117 defeat to the Minnesota Timberwolves, and are eager to improve in the competitive Western Conference.
