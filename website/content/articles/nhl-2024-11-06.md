**Toronto Maple Leafs 4 - 0 Boston Bruins**  
Special teams spark Maple Leafs in shutout of Bruins
 **TORONTO --** The Toronto Maple Leafs scored three power-play goals and went 6-for-6 on the penalty kill, defeating the Boston Bruins 4-0 at Scotiabank Arena on Tuesday. 
“Obviously a big one,” Maple Leafs defenseman <forge-entity title="Morgan Rielly" slug="morgan-rielly-8476853" code="player">Morgan Rielly</forge-entity> said. “I think it comes down to special teams, and we did pretty well in that department and it had a big impact on the game.”

<forge-entity title="Anthony Stolarz" slug="anthony-stolarz-8476932" code="player">Anthony Stolarz</forge-entity> made 29 saves for Toronto, which had lost its previous eight regular-season games against Boston dating to Jan. 14, 2023. It was his first shutout with the Maple Leafs since signing a two-year, $5 million contract ($2.5 million average annual value) as an unrestricted free agent July 2.

“Probably our most complete game of the year,” Stolarz said. “Boston is a very good team. We knew they were physical and they were going to try to grind us down and I think we matched their intensity, matched their physicality really well.” 
Rielly had a goal and two assists, <forge-entity title="William Nylander" slug="william-nylander-8477939" code="player">William Nylander</forge-entity> and <forge-entity title="Matthew Knies" slug="matthew-knies-8482720" code="player">Matthew Knies</forge-entity> each had a goal and an assist, and <forge-entity title="Mitch Marner" slug="mitchell-marner-8478483" code="player">Mitch Marner</forge-entity> had two assists for the Maple Leafs (7-5-2), who had lost two in a row.

<forge-entity title="Jeremy Swayman" slug="jeremy-swayman-8480280" code="player">Jeremy Swayman</forge-entity> made 23 saves for the Bruins (6-7-1), who had won two in a row by shutout (3-0 at the Philadelphia Flyers on Saturday; 2-0 against the Seattle Kraken on Sunday).

“Our special teams, the numbers are the numbers (tonight), right?” Boston coach Jim Montgomery said. “The players that get the privilege of either being on the penalty kill or the power play, along with us coaches, need to be better with our plan and we need to be better with our execution.”

Center <forge-entity title="Auston Matthews" slug="auston-matthews-8479318" code="player">Auston Matthews</forge-entity>, who is day to day with an upper-body injury, missed the game for the Maple Leafs. Toronto is 36-19-2 without Matthews in the lineup since he entered the NHL in the 2016-17 season.

“Maybe everybody just adds a little more compete to their game,” Nylander said. “Guys are moved up in some spots. … It’s hard to cover up for him, but everybody did their job.”

Rielly put Toronto up 1-0 on the power play at 8:44 of the second period when he shot past Swayman’s glove from the point. The goal ended the Bruins’ shutout streak at 156:31. 
Nylander made it 2-0 at 9:58 with another power-play goal. His pass from along the goal line near the left corner ricocheted off Boston defenseman Brandon Carlo’s leg at the top of the crease.

Nylander has scored in four of his past five games (five goals).

“He’s being Willy,” Toronto coach Craig Berube said. “He scores goals. He’s a dynamic player. He’s one of those offensive guys where the puck goes to him. He knows where the puck is going, got a great shot, we all know that. His skill level is off the charts but he’s playing a good game all around, not just thinking about offense.”

Stolarz preserved the two-goal lead at 10:36 when he slid to his right to stop a one-timer from <forge-entity title="Justin Brazeau" slug="justin-brazeau-8479638" code="player">Justin Brazeau</forge-entity> on a 3-on-1.

“Some massive saves,” Marner said. “A couple massive back-door saves coming across the crease. Stolarz has been doing it all year for us in that net, so big kudos to him. It definitely could have been a different game or different score without him.”

Knies pushed it to 3-0 on the man-advantage at 14:13 of the third period when he deflected a shot from Nylander at the top of the crease.

“Our power play was clicking,” Nylander said. “We got my lucky goal which set us up a little bit, but our penalty kill was great. We played a great special teams game tonight, which was huge for our club, and Stolarz was obviously incredible.” 
The Maple Leafs were 3-for-7 on the power play, the first time this season they have scored more than two power-play goals in a game. They are 7-for-47 (14.1 percent) on the man-advantage this season.

“I don’t think we are going to get carried away thinking we got anything solved,” Rielly said. “I think it was just a matter of time, it was just about sticking with the process and we wanted to shoot more pucks, get more traffic and I thought we did those things, but by no means did we have everything all sorted out now moving forward.”

<forge-entity title="Steven Lorentz" slug="steven-lorentz-8478904" code="player">Steven Lorentz</forge-entity> scored into an empty net at 15:58 for the 4-0 final.

“Honestly, it was a tough loss today but I feel like we’ve been right there for the most part of the game,” Bruins forward <forge-entity title="David Pastrnak" slug="david-pastrnak-8477956" code="player">David Pastrnak</forge-entity> said. “Special teams obviously hurt us today. We didn’t do the job on the power play and they did.”

**NOTES:** The Bruins defeated the Maple Leafs 4-3 in the best-of-7 first round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs last season. … Bruins defenseman <forge-entity title="Andrew Peeke" slug="andrew-peeke-8479369" code="player">Andrew Peeke</forge-entity> left the game with an upper-body injury at 11:24 of the first period after taking a hit along the boards from <forge-entity title="Max Pacioretty" slug="max-pacioretty-8474157" code="player">Max Pacioretty</forge-entity>. Montgomery did not have an update after the game. … <forge-entity title="Tyler Johnson" slug="tyler-johnson-8474870" code="player">Tyler Johnson</forge-entity> had one shot on goal in 13:51 of ice time in his Boston debut and first game of the season after signing a one-year, $775,000 contract on Monday. The forward had been with the Bruins on a professional tryout. … Pastrnak had four shots and was minus-1 in 22:09 after being benched for the third period on Sunday in what Montgomery called “a coach’s decision.” … Marner extended his point streak to six games (one goal, eight assists).

**Montreal Canadiens 2 - 3 Calgary Flames**  
In an electrifying encounter at the Bell Centre, the Calgary Flames edged the Montreal Canadiens 3-2 in overtime, led by Matt Coronato, who netted the tying goal with just under three minutes left in regulation and clinched the victory a mere seven seconds into overtime. Starting his rush from a center-ice face-off, Coronato's lethal shot beat Montreal goalie Sam Montembeault, emphasizing his scoring prowess which drew praise from Flames' goalie Dustin Wolf. The Flames had initially taken the lead with a goal from Connor Zary, only for Joel Armia and Brendan Gallagher to respond for Montreal, though Gallagher's second tally was negated by an offside review. With Calgary breaking a slump of five losses in six games, Montreal's struggles continued, marking their fourth straight defeat. Notably, Coronato's overtime goal nearly matched the fastest record in NHL history, missing by just one second, highlighting the dramatic finish to a tightly contested match.

**Carolina Hurricanes 6 - 4 Philadelphia Flyers**  
Martin Necas secured the Carolina Hurricanes' seventh consecutive win by scoring with just 31 seconds remaining in their 6-4 victory against the Philadelphia Flyers at Lenovo Center. His late goal, a rebound at the left post, not only clinched the game but extended his point streak to seven games, accumulating six goals and 11 assists. Despite not being their sharpest performance, according to coach Rod Brind’Amour, the Hurricanes managed to outmaneuver the Flyers with significant contributions from players like Jackson Blake and Jack Roslovic, while Pyotr Kochetkov made 12 saves. Travis Konecny shone for the Flyers with two goals and two assists, but his efforts fell short as Philadelphia recorded their fewest shots this season. Aleksei Kolosov's 29-save effort could not prevent the Flyers from suffering another defeat after a brief winning streak, highlighting the resilience and depth of the winning Hurricanes squad.

**New York Islanders 4 - 3 Pittsburgh Penguins**  
The New York Islanders pulled off an impressive comeback victory against the Pittsburgh Penguins, rallying from a two-goal deficit in the third period to win 4-3 in a shootout at UBS Arena. Key moments included Bo Horvat scoring the decisive shootout goal, sliding the puck under goaltender Alex Nedeljkovic, who also recorded 23 saves. Kyle Palmieri contributed a goal and an assist, while Ilya Sorokin made 32 saves and denied all shootout attempts. The Penguins were initially on top, with Sidney Crosby netting his 598th career goal and Evgeni Malkin adding a goal and an assist, yet they couldn't maintain their lead against the Islanders' persistent push. Notably, Simon Holmstrom scored his first career power-play goal, continuing his scoring streak against Pittsburgh, and Isaiah George debuted for the Islanders. Crosby extended his point streak to four games, contributing to an exciting matchup marked by the Islanders' determination and strategic adjustments in the final period.

**St Louis Blues 3 - 2 Tampa Bay Lightning**  
In a tight matchup, the St. Louis Blues secured a 3-2 victory over the Tampa Bay Lightning at the Enterprise Center, with Jordan Binnington making 21 saves and moving into second place on the Blues' all-time wins list with his 149th NHL win. Binnington surpassed Jake Allen, trailing only Mike Liut. Key contributors for the Blues included Jordan Kyrou, Oskar Sundqvist, and Alexey Toropchenko, each notching a goal and helping St. Louis start their five-game homestand with two consecutive victories. The game was briefly overshadowed by a scary incident involving Blues forward Dylan Holloway, who was taken to the hospital after being hit in the neck by a deflected puck. Despite the scare, teammates rallied around the news of Holloway's recovery to complete the win. The Lightning, who have now lost three straight despite efforts from Nikita Kucherov and Andrei Vasilevskiy, were unable to capitalize on their early lead and missed the presence of injured star Brayden Point. Noteworthy performances included Kucherov and Victor Hedman, who remain on point streaks, highlighting individual talent amidst the team's challenging stretch.

**Winnipeg Jets 3 - 0 Utah Hockey Club**  
Hellebuyck makes 21 saves, Jets shut out Utah Hockey Club for 4th straight win
 **WINNIPEG --** <forge-entity title="Connor Hellebuyck" slug="connor-hellebuyck-8476945" code="player">Connor Hellebuyck</forge-entity> made 21 saves, and <forge-entity title="Nino Niederreiter" slug="nino-niederreiter-8475799" code="player">Nino Niederreiter</forge-entity> scored two goals in his 900th NHL game for the Winnipeg Jets in a 3-0 win against the Utah Hockey Club at Canada Life Centre on Tuesday. 
“The game wasn’t very pretty,” Niederreiter said. “There wasn’t a whole lot of flow out there. I think that is something that we knew and just had to stick with and do the little things right. Eventually we would create our own luck, and that’s what happened there.”

<forge-entity title="Gabriel Vilardi" slug="gabriel-vilardi-8480014" code="player">Gabriel Vilardi</forge-entity> also scored for the Jets (12-1-0), who have won four straight since their loss to the Toronto Maple Leafs on Oct. 28. <forge-entity title="Adam Lowry" slug="adam-lowry-8476392" code="player">Adam Lowry</forge-entity> had two assists. <forge-entity title="Kyle Connor" slug="kyle-connor-8478398" code="player">Kyle Connor</forge-entity>’s season-opening point streak ended at a franchise-record 12 games (19 points; nine goals, 10 assists).

“It was a grind,” Winnipeg coach Scott Arniel said. “We had talked this morning about Utah, they were making it difficult on us in letting us get into the interior and letting us get second chances. But I like the way we kind of hung with it. … Our PK was really good against a dangerous looking group that they have.” 
<forge-entity title="Karel Vejmelka" slug="karel-vejmelka-8478872" code="player">Karel Vejmelka</forge-entity> made 25 saves for the Utah (5-5-3), which has lost six of seven (1-4-2).

“I feel bad for \[Vejmelka\], he was really good,” Utah coach Andre Tourigny said. “We don't support him offensively. I feel really bad for him because he played really solid.”

Vilardi gave the Jets a 1-0 lead at 17:57 of the second period with a power-play goal, redirecting <forge-entity title="Josh Morrissey" slug="josh-morrissey-8477504" code="player">Josh Morrissey</forge-entity>’s shot from the left point past Vejmelka.

“They capitalize on one of their power plays, and we didn’t,” Utah forward <forge-entity title="Lawson Crouse" slug="lawson-crouse-8478474" code="player">Lawson Crouse</forge-entity> said. “We had a couple looks late in the game that would have been nice to go in. They're a big, strong team. A veteran team. They play sound hockey all over the ice.” 
Niederreiter pushed it to 2-0 at 7:30 of the third period, taking <forge-entity title="Mason Appleton" slug="mason-appleton-8478891" code="player">Mason Appleton</forge-entity>’s centering pass and deking Vejmelka to finish a 3-on-2 rush.

“Tonight we did a really good job of defending and coming back hard,” Morrissey said. “They’re a really skilled top six and they’ve got a lot of guys up there that can make the seam passes and lots of good plays off the rush. So I thought we did a good job defending our blue line, first off, and then not giving up too much in the middle of the ice.”

Niederreiter scored an empty-net goal at 17:01 for the 3-0 final.

“The best part about it right now is that we keep finding ways to win hockey games, and in all situations” Niederreiter said. “The power play steps up when it needs to. The PK has been great. We are finding the back of the net right now, which is great. It is something that we work very hard for it. We know we can’t take anything for granted.

**NOTES:** Connor’s season-opening point streak ended one game shy of the longest by a U.S.-born player in NHL history, a mark set by Kevin Stevens (14 goals, 19 assists in 13 games) with the Pittsburgh Penguins in 1992-93. … Hellebuyck’s second shutout of the season is the 39th of his career, passing <forge-entity title="Tom Barrasso" slug="tom-barrasso-8445275" code="player">Tom Barrasso</forge-entity> for the sixth-most by a U.S.-born goaltender in NHL history.
