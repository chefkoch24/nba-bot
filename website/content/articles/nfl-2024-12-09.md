**New York Giants 11 - 14 New Orleans Saints**  
In a tense showdown at MetLife Stadium, the New Orleans Saints edged past the New York Giants 14-11, thanks to a crucial blocked field goal by Bryan Bresee in the final seconds. This victory was marred by an injury to Saints quarterback Derek Carr, who hurt his non-throwing hand late in the game after a dive for a first down. The Saints, under interim coach Darren Rizzi, secured their third win in four games, staying within striking distance of NFC South rivals Tampa Bay and Atlanta. Despite a spirited comeback led by Giants quarterback Drew Lock, who orchestrated a late drive to the Saints' 12-yard line, the Giants fell short as their losing streak at home continued. The frustration in New York is palpable, with fans even resorting to an aerial protest before the game. The Saints now prepare to host Washington, while the Giants, amidst mounting calls for leadership changes, gear up to face Baltimore.

**Pittsburgh Steelers 27 - 14 Cleveland Browns**  
In a dominant performance, the Pittsburgh Steelers defeated the error-prone Cleveland Browns 27-14, bolstered by Russell Wilson's two touchdown passes. Despite missing key receiver George Pickens, the Steelers capitalized on Cleveland's mistakes, with Cam Heyward contributing two sacks and Keeanu Benton grabbing a pivotal interception that led to a Najee Harris touchdown. Jameis Winston, who completed 24 of 41 passes for 211 yards, threw two interceptions while missed field goals from Dustin Hopkins and ill-timed penalties plagued the Browns, resulting in their 18th season with double-digit losses since 1999. The win moved the Steelers to a 10-3 record, maintaining their lead in the AFC North, with challenging games against playoff-caliber teams like Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Kansas City ahead. Meanwhile, Nick Chubb's return to Pittsburgh brought a modest 48-yard effort after recovering from a prior knee injury. Despite the victory, the Steelers face a demanding schedule that will test their mettle before the playoffs.

**Minnesota Vikings 42 - 21 Atlanta Falcons**  
Sam Darnold delivered a stellar performance for the Minnesota Vikings, achieving career highs of 347 passing yards and five touchdowns in a 42-21 victory over the Atlanta Falcons, which marked the Vikings' sixth consecutive win. The Vikings' offense, under head coach Kevin O'Connell, put up 40 points for the first time in three seasons, with standout performances from Jordan Addison and Justin Jefferson, who each recorded over 100 receiving yards and multiple touchdowns. The game was highlighted by the Vikings' creative celebrations, including a team dance inspired by the film "White Chicks." Former Viking Kirk Cousins struggled in his return to Minneapolis, throwing two interceptions in a disappointing outing for the Falcons, marking their fourth straight loss and moving them out of first place in the NFC South. The win keeps Minnesota just one game behind NFC North-leading Detroit, with a critical matchup against the Lions looming.

Baker Mayfield, despite three first-half turnovers, threw for 295 yards and three touchdowns, including two to rookie Jalen McMillan, while Rachaad White contributed both a rushing and receiving touchdown. The Bucs capitalized on their momentum even with a rocky start and a competitive first half. Raiders quarterback Aidan O'Connell suffered a knee injury in the third quarter, leading to Desmond Ridder's appearance, but the Raiders couldn't overcome their offensive struggles. On a brighter note for Las Vegas, tight end Brock Bowers set a record for most receptions in a season by a rookie tight end. Despite their effort, the Raiders have now lost nine straight games, as they continue facing an uphill battle. Meanwhile, the Buccaneers look to maintain their division lead with four critical games remaining.

**Arizona Cardinals 18 - 30 Seattle Seahawks**  
The Seattle Seahawks secured a dominant 30-18 victory over the Arizona Cardinals, bolstered by Zach Charbonnet's career-high 134 rushing yards and two touchdowns, as well as crucial interceptions in the first quarter. The win extends Seattle's streak to four and maintains their lead in the NFC West while marking their seventh consecutive win against the Cardinals. Despite a strong start by Arizona, which included a 41-yard touchdown pass from Kyler Murray, the Seahawks took control, highlighted by Charbonnet's impressive 51-yard touchdown run. Geno Smith contributed with 233 passing yards and a touchdown without being sacked, thanks to a strong performance by the offensive line. Arizona's Kyler Murray threw for 259 yards and two touchdowns but endured back-to-back first-quarter interceptions, his first consecutive games with at least two interceptions in his career, hampering the Cardinals' comeback efforts. The Cardinals' struggles continued with missed opportunities, including a crucial missed field goal by Chad Ryland, marking his third straight game with a missed attempt.

**Philadelphia Eagles 22 - 16 Carolina Panthers**  
In a narrow 22-16 victory over the Carolina Panthers, Philadelphia Eagles' Saquon Barkley shone brightly, rushing for 124 yards and breaking the team's season rushing record. Despite securing a playoff spot due to other teams' losses, the Eagles were left frustrated with their passing game, as star receivers DeVonta Smith and A.J. Brown struggled to make an impact with only four catches each. Quarterback Jalen Hurts managed two touchdown passes and a rushing score but endured four sacks and didn't capitalize on open receivers, leading to dissatisfaction within the team. C.J. Gardner-Johnson's crucial interception helped shift momentum, and a late defensive stand thwarted the Panthers' Bryce Young, who otherwise put up a spirited performance. Injuries marred the game for the Panthers, with Jonathon Brooks re-injuring his knee and Raheem Blackshear suffering a chest injury. As the Eagles look ahead, improving their pass game remains a priority, aiming to boost their receivers' productivity as they approach the postseason.

The Kansas City Chiefs clinched their ninth consecutive AFC West title by narrowly defeating the Los Angeles Chargers 19-17, thanks to Matthew Wrightâ€™s dramatic 31-yard field goal that bounced off the upright as time expired. Patrick Mahomes orchestrated a crucial 4 1/2-minute drive, showcasing his resilience by converting key plays, including a pivotal pass to Travis Kelce, to set up Wright's game-winning kick. The Chiefs, who have won 10 games by one-score margins this season, initially led 13-0 at halftime but faced a fierce Chargers comeback led by Justin Herbert, who threw for 213 yards and a touchdown. Mahomes also reached a career milestone by surpassing Dan Marino's record for the most passing yards in the first eight years.

Tennessee, now 1-5 at home under first-year coach Brian Callahan, missed opportunities, failing to score on two critical red zone trips.

**Miami Dolphins 32 - 26 New York Jets**  
In a thrilling overtime match, the Miami Dolphins kept their playoff hopes alive with a 32-26 victory over the New York Jets, thanks to Tua Tagovailoa's 10-yard touchdown pass to Jonnu Smith.
