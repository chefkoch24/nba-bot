**Minnesota Timberwolves 119 - 115 Boston Celtics**  
In a thrilling contest, Anthony Edwards scored 39 points to lead the Minnesota Timberwolves to a 119-115 victory over the Boston Celtics, marking their first win against a team with a .500 or better record in eight attempts this season.

Despite the Celtics' Jaylen Brown tying his season high with 41 points and setting a historical first-half record with 27 points, five rebounds, five assists, and three steals, the Timberwolves managed to outlast Boston. Jaylen Brown had been questionable due to back spasms but led Boston to a halftime advantage. A strong third-quarter performance, featuring a 24-12 run by Edwards and Terrence Shannon Jr., helped Minnesota regain control. The game also showcased impressive performances by Neemias Queta with a career-high 18 rebounds and tied career-best 19 points.

**LA Clippers 110 - 114 Dallas Mavericks**  
In a clash between the Dallas Mavericks and Los Angeles Clippers, both teams sought redemption after recent losses, with rookie Cooper Flagg spotlighted for the Mavericks. Dallas recently welcomed back Anthony Davis after a 14-game absence, but his 12-point, five-rebound performance couldn't prevent a 129-119 loss to the Lakers. Notably, Flagg, the top pick in the June draft, achieved double figures in almost all his games despite a thumb injury impacting his three-point shooting. For the Clippers, Kawhi Leonard has been cautious in his return from an ankle injury, putting up 39 points in just 29 minutes in their loss to Memphis. With Leonard's history of not playing in back-to-backs, the Clippers may miss his presence. Meanwhile, James Harden logged substantial minutes on a sore foot but may sit out due to the grueling schedule. Coach Tyronn Lue's comments highlighted the challenge of missing key players, particularly illustrating the dependence on marquee stars like Leonard.
