In a thrilling matchup at Amerant Bank Arena, the Florida Panthers triumphed over the New York Rangers 5-3, with Jesper Boqvist scoring twice, including the crucial go-ahead goal in the final minutes. Boqvist's goals were especially significant as he capitalized on brother Adam Boqvist's shot rebound with family members watching. The Panthers, entering this game after consecutive shutouts, saw additional goals from Eetu Luostarinen, Mackie Samoskevich, and an empty-netter by Aleksander Barkov. Florida's victory highlighted their stellar performance when leading after two periods, maintaining an unbeaten streak. On the Rangers' side, the game marked a significant milestone for Artemi Panarin, who became the fastest player in franchise history to reach 500 points, surpassing Mark Messier. Despite their efforts, including goals by Ryan Lindgren, Filip Chytil, and Chris Kreider, the Rangers faced another setback in their challenging season.

**Winnipeg Jets 3 - 0 Nashville Predators**  
Vilardi scores twice, Jets shut out Predators
 **WINNIPEG --** <forge-entity title="Gabriel Vilardi" slug="gabriel-vilardi-8480014" code="player">Gabriel Vilardi</forge-entity> scored twice in the span of 1:02, <forge-entity title="Connor Hellebuyck" slug="connor-hellebuyck-8476945" code="player">Connor Hellebuyck</forge-entity> made 22 saves for his NHL-leading fifth shutout, and the Winnipeg Jets won 3-0 against the Nashville Predators at Canada Life Centre on Monday. 
“You've got to have good special teams to win in this league,” Vilardi said. “These games are so tight against other top teams and a lot of times it comes down to special teams, and we won that battle tonight and that's a big reason we won that game.”

<forge-entity title="Dylan DeMelo" slug="dylan-demelo-8476331" code="player">Dylan DeMelo</forge-entity> also scored for the Jets (27-10-1), who have won four straight and are 7-1-1 in their past nine. <forge-entity title="Kyle Connor" slug="kyle-connor-8478398" code="player">Kyle Connor</forge-entity> and <forge-entity title="Nikolaj Ehlers" slug="nikolaj-ehlers-8477940" code="player">Nikolaj Ehlers</forge-entity> each had two assists.

“Hey, it's always fun winning,” Vilardi said. “I think we have a really good team. When we play to our structure and our identity I think we're really tough to beat, really tough to score on. And part was \[Hellebuyck\], obviously. It's fun to win. Got to keep going, though.” 
<forge-entity title="Juuse Saros" slug="juuse-saros-8477424" code="player">Juuse Saros</forge-entity> made 25 saves for the Predators (11-19-7), who have lost two straight coming out of the holiday break.

“It was a close hockey game, kind of low-event, tight-checking. Both teams didn’t give up a whole lot,” Nashville coach Andrew Brunette said. “We kind of made a mistake there in the second, and then obviously the power play in the third. (We) kind of mismanaged the puck a few times and got caught a little bit. So, margins are small and we found a way to lose it tonight.”

DeMelo gave the Jets a 1-0 lead at 17:18 of the second period, taking <forge-entity title="Morgan Barron" slug="morgan-barron-8480289" code="player">Morgan Barron</forge-entity>’s cross-slot pass from the bottom of the circle and scoring with a wrist shot over Saros’ glove.

“That was great for \[DeMelo\] to come in that weak side,” Winnipeg coach Scott Arniel said. "Great play by Barron to find him. We've talked about all year, getting different people chipping in and helping offensively. ... When your defense can be part of that offense, that’s big.” 
Vilardi made it 2-0 at 13:44 when he found space in the slot during a 5-on-3 power play. He then scored another power-play goal during the 5-on-4 at 14:46, jamming the puck in at the left post after Connor's one-timer hit him in the skates to make it 3-0.

“We've talked a lot about \[Connor and Mark Scheifele\] and I keep reminding everybody there's a third guy on that line,” Arniel said of Vilardi. “And whether that's 5-on-5 or on the power play, he's a big body guy that has some great hands on him and he doesn't stray too far away from that net. (He) doesn’t need much time and it doesn't take much. They just get it close to his blade and he's going to get it (and) usually get a shot off.”

Winnipeg, which went 2-for-5 with the man-advantage, ranks first in the NHL on the power play this season (32.5 percent).

“First of all they've got a lot of skill, obviously," Predators captain Roman Josi said. "I feel like they're really good down low making those little plays around the net, and obviously Connor and Scheifele, they're great at finding each other, and \[Josh\] Morrissey moves very well on the blue line. Just a really complete power play and (they’re) making some really good plays.”

**NOTES:** In addition to his five shutouts, Hellebuyck also leads the NHL in save-percentage (.930), goals-against average (2.00), and wins (24-5-1). … Connor has 15 points (six goals, nine assists) on a seven-game point streak. … DeMelo’s goal is his first since April 9. … Predators forward <forge-entity title="Filip Forsberg" slug="filip-forsberg-8476887" code="player">Filip Forsberg</forge-entity>’s six-game assist streak (11) ended.

**Seattle Kraken 5 - 2 Utah Hockey Club**  
In a dynamic game at Climate Pledge Arena, Jaden Schwartz led the Seattle Kraken to a 5-2 victory over the Utah Hockey Club, scoring one goal and assisting on two others in the decisive third period. The Kraken broke away with goals from Schwartz, Matty Beniers, and an empty-netter from Jared McCann, to secure their second win in a row following a five-game losing streak. Philipp Grubauer made 28 saves, contributing significantly to the victory. Utah initially led with Logan Cooley's power-play goal, extending his road point streak to 10 games, but despite a tying goal from Alex Kerfoot, they couldn't overcome Seattle's offensive surge. Utah's coach Andre Tourigny highlighted the need for patience in their gameplay, as the team suffered its fourth consecutive loss. Kaapo Kakko had a notable performance with two assists in his first multipoint game with the Kraken since joining from the New York Rangers, underscoring the growing chemistry between Seattle's forward lines.
