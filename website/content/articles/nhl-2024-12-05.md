**Toronto Maple Leafs 3 - 2 Nashville Predators**  
The Toronto Maple Leafs, buoyed by Auston Matthews' two-goal performance, overcame the Nashville Predators 3-2 in a tense game at Scotiabank Arena. With Matthews back in top form following a nine-game absence due to injury, the Leafs erupted with three goals in the third period, securing their third consecutive win. Mitch Marner added three assists, extending his point streak to eight games, while Toronto's goalie Joseph Woll made 22 critical saves. The Predators initially took an early lead with Jonathan Marchessault's unconventional goal, marking his 500th NHL point. However, Nashville faltered in the third period, which Nashville's coach Andrew Brunette described as disappointing due to turnovers leading to Toronto's decisive goals. Despite Juuse Saros' 25 saves and a late goal by Mark Jankowski, Nashville's winless streak stretched to five games.

**Chicago Blackhawks 2 - 4 Boston Bruins**  
In a compelling matchup at the United Center, Brad Marchand and Morgan Geekie each netted two goals to lead the Boston Bruins to a 4-2 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks. This win marked the Bruins' first three-game winning streak of the season, showcasing a strong performance under interim coach Joe Sacco. Notably, Marchand reached the 10-goal milestone for the 15th time in his career, tying him with Patrice Bergeron for the second-most game-winning goals in franchise history at 81. The Bruins also benefited from outstanding assists by David Pastrnak and Justin Brazeau, while goalie Jeremy Swayman secured the win with 20 saves. Meanwhile, the Blackhawks continued their struggles, losing their fourth consecutive game despite a spirited effort that featured an early goal by Alex Vlasic and a late rally attempt by Jason Dickinson. The Bruins' victory speaks to their resilience, especially given their back-to-back game scenario and their ongoing adjustment under new coaching leadership.

**Anaheim Ducks 1 - 4 Vegas Golden Knights**  
Shea Theodore played a key role in the Vegas Golden Knights' 4-1 victory over the Anaheim Ducks by scoring two goals, including an empty-netter, at Honda Center on Wednesday. William Karlsson and Alexander Holtz also found the net for Vegas, while Ilya Samsonov made 19 saves to secure the win. The Golden Knights, improving to an impressive 6-1-1 record over their last eight games, benefited from standout performances by Jack Eichel, Tomas Hertl, and Victor Olofsson, each contributing two assists. Jackson LaCombe scored the sole goal for Anaheim, and John Gibson made 29 saves. The game took a concerning turn for the Ducks when forward Trevor Zegras, who previously missed 51 games due to injuries last season, left the ice with a lower-body injury early in the second period and did not return.
