**Toronto Raptors 128 - 100 Milwaukee Bucks**  
The Toronto Raptors secured a commanding victory over the Milwaukee Bucks with a 128-100 win, marking their largest margin of victory this season. Scottie Barnes and RJ Barrett both contributed 23 points for the Raptors. Despite Barnes leaving the game in the first half due to a thumb injury, X-rays cleared him to return in the second half. The Bucks, who were experiencing their most significant defeat of the season, struggled with their shooting, particularly from long range, making only 11 out of 38 three-pointers. Giannis Antetokounmpo led the Bucks with 22 points. Jakob Poeltl made a notable return for Toronto after missing three games, adding eight points and nine rebounds. This win helped the Raptors extend their winning streak to three games, while the Bucks failed to capitalize on their previous win against Indiana and spoil Toronto's attempt at seeking revenge for their home opener loss.

**Atlanta Hawks 127 - 112 Orlando Magic**  
In a dominant performance, the Atlanta Hawks secured a wire-to-wire 127-112 victory over the Orlando Magic on Tuesday night. Zaccharie Risacher led the charge with 21 points, and Nickeil Alexander-Walker contributed 20, as part of a balanced offensive effort that saw five Hawks scoring in double figures. Dyson Daniels was particularly efficient, hitting 8 of 9 shots and extending his streak to 60 consecutive games with at least one steal, the second-longest in franchise history. Atlanta, improving its record against the Magic to 2-0 this season, also showcased a commanding 55.6% shooting accuracy and a 25-point lead, while Orlando struggled with discipline, committing 30 fouls and losing Desmond Bane to ejection in the third quarter following a flagrant and technical foul incident. The Hawks' offensive pushes included impressive scoring runs and consistent output across quarters, while Paolo Banchero's notable performance of 22 points, 11 rebounds, and 8 assists wasn't enough to challenge Atlanta's control.

**Chicago Bulls 113 - 111 Philadelphia 76ers**  
In a thrilling NBA matchup, the Chicago Bulls overcame a 24-point deficit to snatch a 113-111 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers. Josh Giddey was instrumental for the Bulls, achieving a triple-double with 29 points, 15 rebounds, and 12 assists, becoming the first Bulls player to record back-to-back triple-doubles since Michael Jordan in 1989. Giddey played a crucial role in the final moments, assisting Nikola Vucevic for a game-winning 3-pointer with just 3.2 seconds left. Philadelphia had a chance to secure the win, but Quentin Grimes missed a 3-pointer at the final buzzer. Despite an early 18-point lead, fueled by Tyrese Maxey's 39-point performance, and a strong first quarter, the 76ers couldn't sustain their advantage, scoring only 16 points in the fourth quarter. Noteworthy off the court was the halftime performance by Red Panda, marking her return after a wrist injury. The victory improved Chicago’s record to 6-1, while Philadelphia dropped to 5-2.

In an exciting matchup, the New Orleans Pelicans secured their first victory of the season by overcoming the Charlotte Hornets, 116-112, thanks to a decisive 3-pointer from Jose Alvarado with just 16 seconds remaining. The Pelicans, who had lost their first six games, were fueled by Trey Murphy III's 21 points, with Alvarado contributing 18 and Saddiq Bey adding 17. This win left the Brooklyn Nets as the NBA's only winless team at 0-7. Despite missing LaMelo Ball due to a right ankle injury, the Hornets saw strong performances from Miles Bridges, who scored 22 points, and rookie Kon Knueppel, who recorded 20 points and 12 rebounds.

**Golden State Warriors 118 - 107 Phoenix Suns**  
In a high-stakes matchup, the Golden State Warriors aim to maintain their perfect home record against the Phoenix Suns, a team yet to secure an away victory this season. Coming off a two-game losing streak to the Milwaukee Bucks and Indiana Pacers, the Warriors have shown impressive performances at their home games, including a notable overtime win against the Denver Nuggets. Stephen Curry, who took partial responsibility for the recent losses due to turnovers, aims to improve against a Suns team led by Devin Booker, who has excelled following Kevin Durant's departure to Houston. The Suns, fresh off back-to-back victories at home, struggle on the road but look to capitalize on Booker's offensive prowess against a Warriors defense that recently faltered against perimeter threats in Milwaukee and Indiana. Both teams are eager to capitalize on their recent form, with Booker emphasizing the importance of maintaining momentum after the Suns bounced back from a challenging road trip.

**LA Clippers 86 - 94 Oklahoma City Thunder**  
The Oklahoma City Thunder, riding a seven-game winning streak to start the season, are set to face the Los Angeles Clippers in Inglewood after Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led them to a dominant 137-106 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans. Gilgeous-Alexander, averaging 33.6 points this season, continues to shine by scoring at least 30 points in six of seven games, despite his lower three-point shooting percentage of 26.8%. Reflecting on his time with the Clippers and his subsequent trade to Oklahoma City, Gilgeous-Alexander expressed a strong desire to prove himself. Meanwhile, the Clippers, with new star James Harden, narrowly lost to the Miami Heat at home, suffering from 21 turnovers that led to 37 points for their opponents. Coach Tyronn Lue remains concerned about turnovers, while Kawhi Leonard missed a potential game-winning three-pointer and suffered an ankle tweak. With Leonard and Bradley Beal's statuses unclear for the upcoming game, the Clippers are navigating a challenging stretch of home games.
