The Houston Rockets secured their third consecutive victory by defeating the Charlotte Hornets 114-101, with standout performances from Jabari Smith Jr., who posted 21 points and 11 rebounds, and Fred VanVleet, contributing 20 points. The Rockets' youthful lineup dominated early, leading Charlotte by 34 points in the second half, propelled by contributions from Amen Thompson and Cam Whitmore. Houston's defense was formidable, limiting the Hornets to just 15 points in the first quarter and a mere 1 for 11 from three-point range. Despite efforts from Miles Bridges and LaMelo Ball, scoring 24 and 23 points respectively, Charlotte struggled, particularly with their long-distance shooting going 2 for 20 in the first half. The Rockets also controlled the boards, outrebounding the Hornets 59-44, highlighting Thompson's impressive coast-to-coast dunk. A noteworthy incident saw Aaron Holliday ejected after a brief three-minute stint.

**Cleveland Cavaliers 124 - 113 Utah Jazz**  
The Cleveland Cavaliers secured their fifth consecutive win by defeating the Utah Jazz 124-113, marking their 17th victory in 18 home games.

**Atlanta Hawks 117 - 104 Minnesota Timberwolves**  
The Atlanta Hawks secured a 117-104 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves, bolstered by Garrison Mathews' career-high seven 3-pointers and season-high 25 points off the bench. Trae Young, overcoming a bruised heel, contributed 29 points and seven assists, while De'Andre Hunter added 19 points to help the Hawks snap a three-game losing streak. Minnesota's Naz Reid delivered 23 points off the bench, but Anthony Edwards struggled in his hometown appearance with 16 points, shooting 7 for 20 and committing five turnovers. Notably, Dyson Daniels, tasked with guarding Edwards, amassed eight steals. Despite a strong start by the Hawks and a brief Timberwolves rally leading to a 55-52 halftime lead, Atlanta surged ahead with an 8-0 run in the third quarter, largely driven by Mathews. The Hawks capitalized on their 18 for 36 shooting from beyond the arc, marking their return to a .500 record. Meanwhile, the Timberwolves, criticized for a flat start, face a challenging season, exacerbated by Edwards' recent $75,000 fine for critiquing officials.

The Miami Heat ended their three-game losing streak with a 110-95 victory over the Brooklyn Nets, highlighted by Bam Adebayo's strong second-half performance, contributing 17 of his 23 points. Miami showcased their impressive defense once again, maintaining their perfect record (7-0) when holding opponents below 100 points. Nikola Jovic and Tyler Herro also played crucial roles, with Jovic scoring 18 points and Herro adding a double-double with 17 points and 12 rebounds. Despite Jimmy Butler sitting out due to illness, the Heat's effective teamwork enabled them to dominate the second half, outscoring the Nets 52-38. Duncan Robinson's five 3-pointers and Miami's accuracy from the free-throw line, going 21 of 24, were pivotal in extending their lead in the fourth quarter. Brooklyn's struggles continue as they have now lost eight out of their last ten games, with six of those defeats by double digits, reflecting their inconsistent form since a strong November run. Both teams are set for action again on Thursday, with the Nets facing Milwaukee and the Heat playing against Orlando.

The Milwaukee Bucks secured a commanding 112-91 win over the Chicago Bulls as Khris Middleton and Brook Lopez each scored 21 points, with Bobby Portis contributing a double-double of 19 points and 13 rebounds. Key players Giannis Antetokounmpo and Damian Lillard were absent, the former due to back spasms and the latter due to illness, yet the Bucks still managed to shine.

The Bucks excelled from beyond the arc, making 18 three-pointers, while Gary Trent Jr. added 14 points, including four three-pointers. The Bulls, struggling with their shots, made just 10 out of 48 3-point attempts. Despite missing key backcourt players Lonzo Ball and Josh Giddey, Chicago briefly closed the gap to eight points in the third quarter, but Milwaukee quickly regained a substantial lead.

Scotty Pippen Jr., filling in for Morant, delivered an impressive performance by scoring 22 points and dishing out nine assists, continuing his valuable contributions throughout the season. Memphis, known as the NBA's highest-scoring team with an average of 123.1 points per game, displayed their shooting excellence by tying their season high with 73 first-half points and making 45 three-pointers over two consecutive games. Their strong form is highlighted by winning 12 of the past 14 games.

Norman Powell has stepped up as a key playmaker, averaging 23.9 points per game and demonstrating his potential as a first-time All-Star candidate. The Clippers' recent win over Dallas was overshadowed by a loss in the second game of the series, showcasing their inconsistency as they continue to find their rhythm.

Luka Doncic made a strong return from a two-game absence by scoring 27 points, leading the Dallas Mavericks to a dominant 132-108 win over the Portland Trail Blazers.

**Denver Nuggets 117 - 90 Phoenix Suns**  
In a Western Conference showdown between the Phoenix Suns and Denver Nuggets, the Nuggets emerged victorious, led by Nikola Jokic's impressive performance. Jokic powered the team with a triple-double, scoring 27 points, grabbing 13 rebounds, and dishing out 10 assists, crucial in their tight 132-129 overtime win against the New Orleans Pelicans. Despite fatigue from playing back-to-back games and a late-night flight, Denver maintained their undefeated streak in such scenarios this season. The Suns, struggling without key player Devin Booker due to injury, placed more pressure on Kevin Durant, who acknowledged difficulties in handling double teams. Durant's recent high scoring wasn't enough to prevent losses to teams with losing records. Phoenix was also hindered by Grayson Allen's potential absence and limited appearances from Bol Bol due to a knee injury. While the Nuggets capitalized on their momentum, the Suns relied on Durant's leadership and contributions from players like Bradley Beal and Jusuf Nurkic, hoping to remain competitive in the tight Western Conference race.
