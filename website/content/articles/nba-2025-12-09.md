Bennedict Mathurin and Pascal Siakam contributed with 25 and 23 points, respectively, as the team recorded its second consecutive win, improving to a 6-18 record after a challenging start to the season. Despite trailing 77-58 in the third quarter, the Kings mounted a comeback to lead 101-97, driven by Russell Westbrook's fourth triple-double of the season, consisting of 24 points, 14 assists, and 13 rebounds. Nembhard's clutch plays, including crucial three-pointers and a decisive layup, helped Indiana regain control and seal the victory.

**Minnesota Timberwolves 105 - 108 Phoenix Suns**  
In a tightly contested game, the Phoenix Suns narrowly defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 108-105, snapping the Wolves' five-game winning streak. Mark Williams led the Suns with 22 points and seven rebounds, while Collin Gillespie and Dillon Brooks contributed 19 and 18 points, respectively. Despite Anthony Edwards' impressive 40-point performance for Minnesota, the Timberwolves struggled to support his effort, partly due to Rudy Gobert's ejection in the third quarter for a flagrant foul. The Suns capitalized on a strong start to the fourth quarter with a 14-3 run and maintained their lead, withstanding a late-game shot attempt by Jaden McDaniels to tie it. The victory serves as a boost for Phoenix as they prepare to face the Oklahoma City Thunder in the NBA Cup quarterfinals.

**New Orleans Pelicans 132 - 135 San Antonio Spurs**  
The San Antonio Spurs edged out the New Orleans Pelicans 135-132 in a dramatic game highlighted by rookie Dylan Harper's game-winning floater with just 9 seconds on the clock. Despite losing a 20-point halftime lead, the Spurs managed to fend off an impressive comeback from the Pelicans, led by rookie Derik Queen, who achieved his first NBA triple-double with 33 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists. While key players Victor Wembanyama and Zion Williamson were sidelined, others shone, as Harrison Barnes scored 24 for the Spurs and Trey Murphy added 32 for the Pelicans. A stunning 45-point third quarter saw the Pelicans briefly take the lead, but De'Aaron Fox's clutch free throws sealed the Spurs' victory after Saddiq Bey's last-second 3-pointer missed the mark. Both teams saw strong performances with key 3-point shooting and notable contributions from players like Stephon Castle and Julian Champagnie for San Antonio. With this win, the Spurs are set to visit the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Cup quarterfinals, while the Pelicans aim to break their losing streak against Portland.
