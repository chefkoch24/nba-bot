**Oklahoma City Thunder 114 - 88 Minnesota Timberwolves**  
The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Denver Nuggets 125-93 in Game 7 of their second-round series, setting the stage for a Western Conference finals clash with the Minnesota Timberwolves, who have had a six-day rest following their series win over the Golden State Warriors. This marks Oklahoma City's first conference finals appearance since 2016, while Minnesota is making their second consecutive appearance but has never reached the NBA Finals. The series showcases two of the league's top defenses and rising stars Shai Gilgeous-Alexander of the Thunder and Anthony Edwards of the Timberwolves. Gilgeous-Alexander, a frontrunner for MVP, anticipates an intriguing matchup against his cousin, Nickeil Alexander-Walker of the Timberwolves. Despite their personal closeness, both players aim to outperform one another on the court. The regular season series between the teams ended in a split, and Thunder coach Mark Daigneault believes the playoff matchup will differ significantly from past encounters.
