**Florida Panthers 2 - 3 Montreal Canadiens**  
In a decisive 4-1 victory at Amerant Bank Arena, Eetu Luostarinen recorded his first multigoal NHL game, leading the Florida Panthers to their fourth consecutive win against the Montreal Canadiens. Luostarinen's performance included two power-play goals that sandwiched Cole Caufield's equalizer for Montreal. Supporting the Panthers' win, Sam Bennett and Carter Verhaeghe each notched a goal and an assist, while Aaron Ekblad and Oliver Ekman-Larsson contributed two assists each. Anthony Stolarz made 18 saves for Florida. Montreal's struggles continued as they lost their sixth straight game to the Panthers and have been unable to solve Florida's dominance over their last 11 meetings. Despite Jake Allen's 22 saves, the Canadiens failed to capitalize on opportunities, with Montreal coach Martin St. Louis emphasizing the need for caution during the game. Alongside these highlights, Mike Matheson marked his 500th NHL game with an assist, and Verhaeghe extended his point streak to four games.
