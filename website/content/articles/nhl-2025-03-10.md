**Philadelphia Flyers 1 - 3 New Jersey Devils**  
Cody Glass made an impactful debut for the New Jersey Devils, scoring the opening goal in a 3-1 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers. The game at Wells Fargo Center marked Glass's arrival just after a trade from the Pittsburgh Penguins, filling in as New Jersey adapts to the absence of top center Jack Hughes due to injury. Erik Haula contributed a goal and an assist, ending his 29-game scoreless streak, and Jake Allen secured the win with 23 saves, helping the Devils break a three-game losing streak and maintain their third-place position in the Metropolitan Division. Daniel Sprong, also making his Devils debut after a trade, played on a line with Glass and Haula, energizing the team amidst tight playoff competition. Philadelphia's Jamie Drysdale scored in his 200th NHL game, but the Flyers' struggles continued, suffering their fourth consecutive loss. Devils coach Sheldon Keefe highlighted the significance of the win and the positive contributions from the new players, as they navigate team dynamics and strategies moving forward.

**Washington Capitals 4 - 2 Seattle Kraken**  
In a thrilling game at Capital One Arena, Alex Ovechkin scored his 886th career goal, contributing to the Washington Capitals' 4-2 victory over the Seattle Kraken. This win marked the Capitals' fourth consecutive victory, bolstered by Connor McMichael's go-ahead goal in the third period, amidst strong performances from John Carlson and Charlie Lindgren. Ovechkin's empty-net goal brought him within nine of Wayne Gretzky's record, accruing his 1,600th NHL point in the process, a milestone achieved by only 11 players in history. Meanwhile, Seattle, struggling with back-to-back second-game losses, saw scoring efforts from Shane Wright and Jordan Eberle, but failed to convert on power plays, which coach Dan Bylsma pinpointed as a decisive factor. The game also saw Anthony Beauvillier make his Capitals debut and Dylan Strome celebrate his 500th NHL game.

**Minnesota Wild 1 - 3 Pittsburgh Penguins**  
In a 3-1 defeat for the Minnesota Wild against the Pittsburgh Penguins at Xcel Energy Center, Marc-Andre Fleury made 19 saves in what is likely his final game facing his former team. Fleury, a three-time Stanley Cup champion with the Penguins, holds the franchise records for most wins, shutouts, and best goals-against average. Sidney Crosby scored twice, including the game-winning goal, adding to his career milestone as the fourth player in NHL history with 17 career 20-goal seasons with a single franchise. Evgeni Malkin also scored for Pittsburgh, while Tristan Jarry, making his first NHL start since January, stopped 29 shots for the win. Crosby and Malkin scoring in the same game against Fleury marked a notable occasion, while Bryan Rust revealed a pre-game joke about Crosby scoring the game-winner. Minnesota's Ryan Hartman scored the lone goal for Wild, who have now lost two consecutive games. Penguins coach Mike Sullivan achieved his 400th career win, becoming the first U.S.-born coach to reach this milestone.

**Carolina Hurricanes 4 - 2 Winnipeg Jets**  
In an impressive debut for the Carolina Hurricanes, recent acquisitions Mark Jankowski and Logan Stankoven were instrumental in their team's 4-2 victory over the Winnipeg Jets at Lenovo Center.

Carolina, riding a four-game winning streak, benefited from Frederik Andersen's 20 saves. Despite the Jets' aggressive play, including a disallowed goal by Cole Perfetti, they couldn't overcome the Hurricanes' dominance. The game saw a highlight assist from Scott Morrow, earning his first NHL point, and ended with Seth Jarvis securing the win with an empty-net goal.

**New York Rangers 3 - 7 Columbus Blue Jackets**  
Adam Fantilli's second hat trick of the season propelled the Columbus Blue Jackets to a commanding 7-3 victory over the New York Rangers at Madison Square Garden. Fantilli, who now boasts 21 goals this season, delivered a standout performance with three goals, capitalizing on the absence of Sean Monahan to step into a more prominent role. Notably, Zach Werenski's two assists saw him surpass Rick Nash for the most assists in Blue Jackets history. Despite two consecutive short-handed goals by the Rangers, Columbus regained control with contributions from Mathieu Olivier, Dante Fabbro, and Kent Johnson, solidifying their position in the Eastern Conference's first wild-card spot. The Rangers, now three games without a win, continue to trail the Ottawa Senators for the second wild-card position. This game was marked by several intriguing moments, including the Rangers' two short-handed goals during the same penalty kill, a feat they hadn't achieved since March 2014.

**Anaheim Ducks 4 - 1 New York Islanders**  
The Anaheim Ducks secured a 4-1 victory over the New York Islanders at the Honda Center, propelled by Sam Colangelo's two goals, enhancing his streak to four consecutive games with a goal since being recalled from the AHL.

The Islanders, having won four of their previous five games, saw Tony DeAngelo score their sole goal late in the third period. Despite a strong performance from Marcus Hogberg, who returned after recovering from an injury, including saving a penalty shot and thwarting a lacrosse-style attempt, the Islanders struggled against the Ducks' well-executed strategy, which took advantage of pulling Hogberg for an extra attacker. The game noted the continuation of notable streaks, with McTavish extending his point streak to four games and Cutter Gauthier amassing eight points over his last eight appearances.
