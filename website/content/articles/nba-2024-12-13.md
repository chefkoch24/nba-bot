**Boston Celtics 123 - 99 Detroit Pistons**  
The Boston Celtics secured a commanding 123-99 victory over the Detroit Pistons, marking their 20th win of the season, largely thanks to a standout performance from Payton Pritchard, who tallied 27 points and hit seven 3-pointers. Pritchard's impressive shooting also saw him reach a personal milestone of 500 career 3-pointers, joining an elite group of just 10 Celtics to do so. Derrick White contributed significantly with 23 points and seven 3s, helping the Celtics notch their fourth win in five games. Despite the absence of All-Star Jayson Tatum, who was rested due to a sore right knee, and Sam Hauser, out with a strained abdominal muscle, the Celtics showcased a balanced offensive effort. The Celtics connected on 20 3-pointers in total and led by as many as 32 points. On the other hand, Cade Cunningham led the Pistons with 18 points, eight rebounds, and eight assists, but the young Detroit team struggled with consistency, making only 7 of 37 attempts from behind the arc. The Celtics will next face the Washington Wizards, while the Pistons prepare to host the Miami Heat.

**New Orleans Pelicans 109 - 111 Sacramento Kings**  
In a thrilling game, Domantas Sabonis led the Sacramento Kings to a 111-109 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans with a season-high 32 points and 20 rebounds. The Kings, who have been in solid form with three consecutive wins and victories in four of their last five games, benefited from solid performances by De'Aaron Fox and Keegan Murray, both contributing 18 points each. The Pelicans were kept in contention by CJ McCollum's impressive 36-point display, including a dramatic three-point play late in the game that brought them within two points. However, New Orleans faltered with 22 fouls and 17 turnovers, ultimately being outscored 27-17 on free throws. Malik Monk's pivotal defensive play against Dejounte Murray in the final seconds sealed the win for Sacramento. Despite Yves Missi's 11 rebounds for the Pelicans, foul trouble limited his impact, allowing Sabonis to dominate. This victory for Sacramento ties their season low in points in a win, highlighting a resilient defensive effort to maintain their streak.
