In an intense matchup, the Dallas Stars halted the Washington Capitals' 10-game road winning streak with a 3-1 victory at the American Airlines Center. Roope Hintz played a pivotal role, scoring twice, including a power-play goal that tied the game, and another to solidify the lead. Lian Bichsel contributed with a deflected goal from the left point, marking his second goal in just three NHL games. Jake Oettinger was instrumental in goal, making 25 saves to keep the Capitals at bay, despite an early lead from Dylan Strome.

The Panthers, who were shut out in their previous two games, found their scoring touch with contributions from Sam Bennett and Brandon Montour, among others.
