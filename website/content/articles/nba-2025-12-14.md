**Orlando Magic 120 - 132 New York Knicks**  
Jalen Brunson's season-high 40-point performance propelled the New York Knicks to a 132-120 victory over the Orlando Magic, securing their spot in the NBA Cup final against the San Antonio Spurs. The game, characterized by its playoff intensity, saw the Knicks extending their winning streak to five games, with Brunson notching his fourth consecutive 30-plus-point game. He made 16 of 27 shots and recorded eight assists. Notably, the match included a dramatic moment when Orlando's Anthony Black fell as Brunson hit a 3-pointer. Jalen Suggs was a standout for the Magic, scoring 25 points in the first half before leaving in the fourth quarter due to a sore left hip, preventing any potential history of two 50-point scorers in a single game since 2000. Despite Suggs' early exit and the absence of Franz Wagner, the Magic kept the game competitive with 11 lead changes before the Knicks took control in the third quarter.
