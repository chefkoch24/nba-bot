**Orlando Magic 123 - 110 Boston Celtics**  
In their NBA Cup opener, the Orlando Magic secured a 123-110 victory over the Boston Celtics, with Franz Wagner leading the charge with 27 points. Supported by Desmond Bane's 22 points and seven assists, the Magic excelled in a crucial fourth-quarter surge. Despite Jaylen Brown's impressive 32-point performance for the Celtics, including scoring 14 consecutive points in the third quarter, Orlando maintained their advantage, thanks in part to a decisive 17-4 run sparked by Wagner, Bane, and Wendell Carter Jr. Early in the game, the Magic built a 16-point lead during a 20-2 run, their largest of the night. While Payton Pritchard contributed 27 points for Boston, Orlando's remarkable 50% shooting and 17 successful 3-pointers tipped the balance. The Celtics will have a chance for redemption when they face the Magic again on Sunday.

In an exciting NBA Cup opener, the San Antonio Spurs triumphed over the Houston Rockets 121-110, snapping Houston's five-game winning streak. Harrison Barnes led the Spurs with 24 points, contributing the last four points of the game with crucial free throws and a decisive breakaway dunk.

Despite a strong defensive effort from the Rockets, which initially limited Victor Wembanyama to just four points on 2-for-6 shooting, the Spurs still managed to finish the first half with a 12-0 run. This surge was highlighted by Devin Vassell's three-pointer and Stephon Castle's three-point play, compounded by Kevin Durant's third personal foul during the run. Both teams entered the game with a 5-2 record, though the Rockets achieved theirs by overcoming an initial two-game losing streak. The Spurs are set to face the New Orleans Pelicans next, while the Rockets will play against the Milwaukee Bucks.

**Miami Heat 126 - 108 Charlotte Hornets**  
In an NBA Cup game on Friday night, the Miami Heat dominated the Charlotte Hornets with a 126-108 victory, highlighted by a franchise-record 53-point first quarter, the second highest-scoring first quarter in NBA history. Miami's explosive start gave them a 26-point lead early in the second quarter before Charlotte responded with a 27-2 run to close the gap to one point. Despite the Hornets' efforts, they never led, and Miami pulled away in the fourth quarter. Norman Powell led Miami with 25 points, while Andrew Wiggins and Pelle Larsson contributed 22 and 19 points respectively. Rookie Kon Knueppel excelled for the Hornets, scoring 30 points, the most in his professional career. The Heat also made a rare NBA history by becoming the second team in the shot-clock era to score 50 or more points in one quarter and then fewer than 20 in the next, a feat previously achieved by Memphis in March 2023. Hornets rookie Ryan Kalkbrenner's shooting percentage dropped slightly despite a strong showing, going 5-for-7 from the field. This victory was especially poignant for Heat coach Erik Spoelstra, who coached the game a day after his home was destroyed by fire. Miami will host Portland next, while Charlotte will face the Los Angeles Lakers on Monday.

**Memphis Grizzlies 118 - 104 Dallas Mavericks**  
The Memphis Grizzlies captured a decisive 118-104 victory over the Dallas Mavericks in an NBA Cup game, courtesy of strong performances from Ja Morant and rookie Cedric Coward, who each scored 21 points. Notably, Morant also contributed 13 assists, while Coward added nine rebounds as the Grizzlies put an end to their four-game losing streak. Jaren Jackson and Santi Aldama chipped in with 17 and 16 points, respectively. Despite Max Christie's 18 points for Dallas and contributions from players like P.J. Washington and Naji Marshall, the Mavericks struggled in their fourth game without Anthony Davis, hampered by poor 3-point shooting that remained below 20% in the first half. Meanwhile, Memphis capitalized on their shooting accuracy from distance, connecting on 10 of 21 attempts, opening up a dominant 74-51 halftime lead. Although Dallas tried to rally, they couldn't cut the lead below double digits.

Giannis Antetokounmpo's dominant performance led the Milwaukee Bucks to a 126-110 victory over the Chicago Bulls, as they began their NBA Cup title defense. Scoring 41 points, grabbing 15 rebounds, and adding nine assists, Antetokounmpo was particularly influential in the fourth quarter, scoring 19 points to help the Bucks secure the win.

Despite shooting under 61.5% for the first time this season, Giannis contributed significantly alongside teammates Myles Turner, who had his season-high 23 points, and Ryan Rollins, who added 20. On Chicago’s side, Matas Buzelis scored 20 points, and Josh Giddey made headlines by being the first Bulls player since Michael Jordan in 1989 to have triple-doubles in consecutive games. The Bucks faced this challenge without Taurean Prince due to a neck strain, while Ayo Dosunmu returned for the Bulls after a two-game absence. Milwaukee pulled ahead decisively with an 8-0 run in the third quarter, and Giannis's 3-pointer initiated the spurt that solidified their lead.

This was Randle's second triple-double of the week. The Timberwolves shot a season-high 56.8% while Jaden McDaniels contributed 22 points and seven rebounds.

**Denver Nuggets 129 - 104 Golden State Warriors**  
In a crucial game for the Denver Nuggets' hopes in the NBA Cup's West Group C, they face off against the Golden State Warriors on Friday in Denver. The Nuggets need a victory after losing their first round-robin game to Portland, and they also aim to even their season series with the Warriors, who previously edged out Denver in overtime. Golden State's key players Steph Curry, Jimmy Butler, and Draymond Green are expected to return to action after missing the previous game due to various issues. Rookie Will Richard made a significant impact with a career-high 30 points in their absence, earning praise from coach Steve Kerr. The Nuggets, led by Nikola Jokić—averaging a triple-double—have won five of their last six games, thanks to a high-scoring offense averaging 124.6 points. Denver's balanced scoring attack features five players averaging double figures, contrasting with Cameron Johnson's underwhelming start this season.

**Sacramento Kings 101 - 132 Oklahoma City Thunder**  
The Oklahoma City Thunder, led by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, are set to play their first NBA Cup game of the year against the Sacramento Kings, following a narrow 121-119 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers that snapped their eight-game winning streak. Despite blowing a 22-point lead, the Thunder look to bounce back as they face the Kings, who recently defeated the Golden State Warriors 121-116 without key players Domantas Sabonis, Zach LaVine, and Keegan Murray. Gilgeous-Alexander, a former teammate of Russell Westbrook for six days in 2019, has emerged as a top rebounding guard, contributing significantly with 31 points, nine rebounds, and three blocks during their previous matchup. Meanwhile, Westbrook made headlines with a triple-double performance against the Warriors, celebrating his 204th career triple-double and surpassing Jason Kidd on the NBA all-time rebounds list. With these achievements, both guards have solidified their reputations among the best in the league, and the Thunder aim to apply lessons from their recent loss to improve for the upcoming challenge.
