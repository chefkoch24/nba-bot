**New Orleans Pelicans 106 - 110 Los Angeles Lakers**  
The New Orleans Pelicans will face the Los Angeles Lakers in a play-in game after the Lakers dominated the Pelicans in their regular-season finale, leading by as many as 32 points. LeBron James recorded a triple-double in the game, while Anthony Davis left with back spasms but plans to play in the upcoming matchup. CJ McCollum has been a standout for the Pelicans, scoring over 25 points in seven straight games, but couldn't do much against the Lakers. The winner will face the Denver Nuggets in the first round of the Western Conference playoffs, while the loser will get another chance to make the playoff field. Pelicans coach Willie Green emphasizes the need to be more aggressive, physical, and keep the Lakers out of the paint in the upcoming game.
