**New York Jets 9 - 10 Denver Broncos**  
Bo Nix threw his first NFL touchdown pass to help the Denver Broncos edge past a struggling Aaron Rodgers and the New York Jets 10-9 in a rainy, defensive showdown. Nix, who overcame a dismal first half, found Courtland Sutton for an 8-yard score, capping an 87-yard drive that gave Denver the lead. Despite a banged-up Rodgers, who finished with 225 yards but was sacked five times, the Jets couldn't capitalize. The game saw Greg Zuerlein miss a potential game-winning 50-yard field goal for the Jets, and a scary moment occurred when Denver's Tyler Badie was carted off with a back injury. The Broncos' defense held strong in the end, sealing their second consecutive road victory.

**Green Bay Packers 29 - 31 Minnesota Vikings**  
Sam Darnold led the Minnesota Vikings to a narrow 31-29 victory over the Green Bay Packers, maintaining their undefeated record and early NFC North dominance. Darnold threw three touchdown passes, including one to Justin Jefferson who made a spectacular one-handed grab. Despite a strong performance from Packers quarterback Jordan Love, who threw for 389 yards and four touchdowns, his three interceptions hindered Green Bay’s comeback efforts. Jordan Addison made a significant impact with two touchdowns, helping the Vikings achieve a 28-0 lead in the first half. The game was characterized by seven turnovers and Minnesota's strategic capitalization on key Green Bay mistakes. Former Packers running back Aaron Jones, now with the Vikings, had a notable return to Lambeau Field but didn’t score. The Packers made a late push, but an onside kick recovery by Minnesota sealed their win.

**Las Vegas Raiders 20 - 16 Cleveland Browns**  
The Las Vegas Raiders secured a 20-16 victory against the Cleveland Browns, thanks to a strong defensive performance and an unexpected boost in their running game. Despite missing key players like Davante Adams and Maxx Crosby due to injuries, the Raiders held the Browns to just 241 total yards. A pivotal moment came when Charles Snowden sacked Deshaun Watson on fourth down with 41 seconds remaining, thwarting Cleveland's final drive. The Raiders' running back Alexander Mattison contributed 60 yards to the team's 152 total on the ground, marking their highest rushing output of the season. Las Vegas overcame a 10-0 first-quarter deficit, scoring 20 consecutive points before a fumble return touchdown by Cleveland’s Rodney McLeod brought the score close. However, a missed extra point by Browns kicker Dustin Hopkins and a holding penalty that negated an 82-yard touchdown pass to Amari Cooper sealed Cleveland’s fate. The loss leaves the Browns precariously at 1-3, dimming their playoff hopes, while the Raiders improve to 2-2 heading into their next game against the Denver Broncos.

**Los Angeles Chargers 10 - 17 Kansas City Chiefs**  
Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce led the Kansas City Chiefs to a 17-10 comeback victory over the Los Angeles Chargers, marking their first 4-0 start since 2020. Despite being down 10-0 early in the game, Mahomes, who passed for 245 yards and a touchdown, praised the Chiefs’ defense for their pivotal role in the win. The game saw Rashee Rice carted off due to a potential season-ending knee injury after colliding with Mahomes. Kansas City’s defense effectively pressured Justin Herbert, sacking him twice and limiting the Chargers’ running game to just 55 yards. Key moments included Mahomes’ 54-yard touchdown pass to rookie Xavier Worthy and Samaje Perine’s decisive 2-yard touchdown run. Additionally, Kelce set the franchise’s career receptions record, surpassing Tony Gonzalez.

**Atlanta Falcons 26 - 24 New Orleans Saints**  
Younghoe Koo's career-long 58-yard field goal with two seconds remaining secured a dramatic 26-24 victory for the Atlanta Falcons over the New Orleans Saints. Despite not scoring an offensive touchdown, the Falcons capitalized on special teams and defensive plays, including a fumble recovery in the end zone by KhaDarel Hodge and a pick-six by linebacker Troy Andersen. The Saints, led by Derek Carr and highlighted by a late 1-yard touchdown run from Alvin Kamara, initially took a one-point lead, only to be thwarted by a critical pass interference penalty drawn by Darnell Mooney and Koo's game-winning kick. The Saints grappled with injuries, including Taysom Hill and Willie Gay Jr., while the Falcons also faced challenges with key players out. The win marked Koo's eighth game-winning field goal in the final seconds since 2021, the most in the NFL during that period.

The win, highlighted by a commanding first half where Tampa Bay outgained Philadelphia 287-67 yards and took a 24-0 lead, puts the Bucs at a promising 3-1 start to their season. Mike Evans became the Buccaneers' career scoring leader, surpassing Martin Gramatica, as he caught eight passes for 94 yards, including a touchdown. Philadelphia struggled offensively, missing key starters, and failed to mount a successful comeback despite a brief spark in the third quarter led by Saquon Barkley.

The Panthers honored Hall of Famer Julius Peppers at halftime, and first-round pick Xavier Legette shined despite initial drops.

**Arizona Cardinals 14 - 42 Washington Commanders**  
Rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels shined once again, leading the Washington Commanders to a dominant 42-14 win over the Arizona Cardinals for their third consecutive victory. Daniels, the No. 2 overall pick, threw for 233 yards, a touchdown, and ran for another score, making him the fourth quarterback in the Super Bowl era to achieve four rushing touchdowns in his first four career games. Washington's offense, under Daniels' leadership and supported by notable performances from Jeremy McNichols and Brian Robinson Jr., who ran for 101 yards, scored on every drive except for kneel downs and punts. The game, held in Glendale, Arizona, also marked a successful homecoming for Daniels and offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury, adding to the narrative of their sharp rise in the NFL ranks. Despite a strong showing from Arizona's James Conner and rookie Marvin Harrison Jr., the Cardinals couldn’t keep pace. Washington's defense pressured Kyler Murray, sacking him four times and stifling Arizona's offense after their early lead.

The 49ers' defense delivered six sacks and a touchdown despite being hampered by injuries, including the loss of Javon Hargrave.

**Baltimore Ravens 35 - 10 Buffalo Bills**  
In a dominant performance, Derrick Henry rushed for 199 yards, including an 87-yard touchdown on his first carry, and Lamar Jackson contributed two passing touchdowns and one rushing score as the Baltimore Ravens handed the previously unbeaten Buffalo Bills their first loss of the season, 35-10. Jackson completed 13 of 18 passes for 156 yards, while Henry also caught a touchdown pass, his first since 2019. Despite his stellar performance, Henry was disappointed by a late-game fumble at the goal line. The Ravens' defense restricted Josh Allen to 180 passing yards and forced a fumble, with Allen eventually being replaced by backup Mitch Trubisky. Baltimore outgained Buffalo 427 to 236 yards, and several Bills streaks, including their eight-game regular-season win streak and a record 43-game streak of not losing by six or more points, were broken. Key injuries affected both teams, with the Bills' Taylor Rapp suffering a concussion, and the Ravens playing without LG Andrew Vorhees.

**Houston Texans 24 - 20 Jacksonville Jaguars**  
The Houston Texans clinched a dramatic 24-20 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars, highlighted by C.J. Stroud's 345-yard passing performance culminating in a last-minute touchdown pass to third-string running back Dare Ogunbowale. Despite punting on five consecutive possessions and dealing with key injuries to starters Joe Mixon and Dameon Pierce, the Texans mounted a 69-yard drive with less than three minutes remaining to secure the victory. Nico Collins also shone with 12 receptions for 151 yards, marking his third 100-yard game of the season and setting a franchise milestone. On the other hand, the Jaguars, who remain winless at 0-4, missed key opportunities, including a failed fourth-down attempt early in the fourth quarter. Coach Doug Pederson, questioned about his job security, dismissed concerns despite the continued losing streak.

**Indianapolis Colts 27 - 24 Pittsburgh Steelers**  
In an intense matchup, veteran quarterback Joe Flacco stepped in for the injured Anthony Richardson to help the Indianapolis Colts secure a 27-24 victory over the previously unbeaten Pittsburgh Steelers. Flacco, a 39-year-old former Super Bowl MVP, threw two touchdown passes and led a crucial late-game drive that culminated in a key field goal. He completed 16 of 26 passes for 168 yards, connecting frequently with Michael Pittman Jr. who had 113 receiving yards. Despite a strong performance by Steelers' Justin Fields, who threw for 312 yards and had two rushing touchdowns, Pittsburgh couldn't recover from a costly botched snap in the final minutes. Richardson's recurring injuries and a solid Colts defensive stand in the last minute were pivotal. Notably, Flacco's poise and readiness highlighted his extensive experience, proving invaluable in guiding the Colts to their second consecutive win. The game also saw attendance from NFL legend Ben Roethlisberger and Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark.

Caleb Williams led the Chicago Bears to a 24-18 victory over the Los Angeles Rams by orchestrating four scoring drives, with significant contributions from D'Andre Swift, who accumulated 165 scrimmage yards and a touchdown. Williams, the No. 1 overall draft pick, threw for 157 yards and a touchdown without any turnovers, a notable improvement from his previous performance. Jaquan Brisker clinched the win with a late interception, making up for a earlier penalty that negated a different interception. Matthew Stafford showcased his skill with a crafty flick pass and surpassed Eli Manning for 10th on the NFL's all-time passing list but struggled in the red zone and threw a critical interception.
