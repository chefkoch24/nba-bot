**Brooklyn Nets 104 - 116 Los Angeles Lakers**  
LeBron James tied his career high with 9 3-pointers and scored 40 points as the Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Brooklyn Nets 116-104. James hinted at retirement, stating he doesn't have much time left in the NBA, but put on a show with his shooting prowess. The Lakers have won five of their last six games, with James leading the charge alongside Anthony Davis and Rui Hachimura. Cam Thomas tried to rally the Nets in the second half, but Brooklyn struggled to overcome the Lakers' early lead. If James continues his stellar play in the postseason, anything is possible for the ageless wonder.
