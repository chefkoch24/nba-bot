**Montreal Canadiens 3 - 0 Nashville Predators**  
Laine scores in 2nd straight game, Canadiens shut out Predators
 **MONTREAL --** <forge-entity title="Patrik Laine" slug="patrik-laine-8479339" code="player">Patrik Laine</forge-entity> scored for the second straight game, his first two for the Montreal Canadiens, who defeated the Nashville Predators 3-0 at Bell Centre on Thursday. 
Laine scored on a 5-on-3 power play at 1:14 of the third period after scoring a power-play goal in his season and Montreal debut on Tuesday, when he returned from a knee injury he sustained in a preseason game on Sept. 28.

“It feels good,” Laine said. “It felt a little bit better than last game, and obviously the power play, it’s always been fun to play that. So that’s been working out well so far and just try to keep it going.”

<forge-entity title="Sam Montembeault" slug="sam-montembeault-8478470" code="player">Sam Montembeault</forge-entity> made 29 saves for his third shutout, <forge-entity title="Jake Evans" slug="jake-evans-8478133" code="player">Jake Evans</forge-entity> had a goal and an assist, and <forge-entity title="Joel Armia" slug="joel-armia-8476469" code="player">Joel Armia</forge-entity> scored for the Canadiens (10-13-3), who won 2-1 in overtime against the New York Islanders on Tuesday.

Laine, who was acquired in a trade from the Columbus Blue Jackets on Aug. 19, and Armia were named to Finland’s 4 Nations Face-Off roster Wednesday. Montembeault, who was named to Canada’s roster Wednesday, tied <forge-entity title="Connor Hellebuyck" slug="connor-hellebuyck-8476945" code="player">Connor Hellebuyck</forge-entity> of the Winnipeg Jets for the NHL lead in shutouts.

“He’s kept us in the game so many times, just unbelievable, and that’s why they picked him for Team Canada, for that reason,” Laine said. “He shows up in big moments. 5-on-3 against, when you look at the guys they have and nothing goes in, he’s been unreal.” 
<forge-entity title="Justus Annunen" slug="justus-annunen-8481020" code="player">Justus Annunen</forge-entity> made 27 saves in his first start for Nashville (7-14-6), which is 0-3-3 in its past six games, including a 3-2 loss at the Toronto Maple Leafs on Wednesday.

The Predators acquired Annunen in a trade with the Colorado Avalanche on Saturday.

“He did exactly like ‘Juice’ (<forge-entity title="Juuse Saros" slug="juuse-saros-8477424" code="player">Juuse Saros</forge-entity>) does, he gave us a chance to win a hockey game,” Predators forward <forge-entity title="Jonathan Marchessault" slug="jonathan-marchessault-8476539" code="player">Jonathan Marchessault</forge-entity> said. “He was unbelievable, I thought, in the first period. They came out hard and they were good, but he was really good as well. So he gave us a chance to win and we just didn’t win again.”

The Predators were without forward <forge-entity title="Ryan O&#39;Reilly" slug="ryan-o-reilly-8475158" code="player">Ryan O&#39;Reilly</forge-entity>, who missed what would have been his 1,100th NHL game because of a lower-body injury. He is week to week.

“We try the best we can,” Nashville coach Andrew Brunette said about losing O’Reilly. “I think it’s an opportunity for other guys to step up and solidify a little bit of a role and add a little bit to the team.”

Evans gave Montreal a 1-0 lead with a short-handed goal at 7:50 of the first period. He carried the puck up ice along the left side with Armia driving hard to the net and put on the brakes before scoring with a wrist shot over Annunen’s right pad from the face-off circle.

“I was about to pass it to \[Armia\] and then kind of broke that up,” Evans said. “He fooled a lot of people. I’m sure the goalie might have been thinking about that too, so that helped.” 
Laine made it 2-0 with his power-play goal at 1:14 of the third. He took <forge-entity title="Lane Hutson" slug="lane-hutson-8483457" code="player">Lane Hutson</forge-entity>’s cross-ice pass in the left face-off circle and scored on a wrist shot past Annunen stick side that Carrier tried to block after he had broken his stick.

“I just try to shoot the puck when I have a chance,” Laine said. “Obviously 5-on-3 is a little different than 5-on-4, so a little more room. And one guy didn’t have his stick, so it was like a 5-on-2, but it’s not just me, it’s the whole unit. We’re working on it together, reading off each other. It’s only our second game together, but two games, two goals, so I feel we’ve got something going here. And just try to build off of that and create a pretty good weapon for us for the rest of the year.”

Armia shot into an empty net with 46 seconds remaining for the 3-0 final.

“I think it’s a different night, same result kind of thing,” Nashville defenseman <forge-entity title="Alexandre Carrier" slug="alexandre-carrier-8478851" code="player">Alexandre Carrier</forge-entity> said. “We’re trying to produce more offense. We’re trying, but I think we’ve got to get a bit more greasy in front of their net.”

**NOTES:** Laine is the first player to score at least a goal in each of his first two games for Montreal since <forge-entity title="Brian Gionta" slug="brian-gionta-8467407" code="player">Brian Gionta</forge-entity> and [Travis Moen](https://www.nhl.com/player/travis-moen-8468635) did so in their first two games with the Canadiens from Oct. 1-3, 2009. … Nashville had a potential power-play goal waved off at 7:00 of the third when the referees ruled the puck was kicked into the net by <forge-entity title="Gustav Nyquist" slug="gustav-nyquist-8474679" code="player">Gustav Nyquist</forge-entity>. … Predators forward <forge-entity title="Michael McCarron" slug="michael-mccarron-8477446" code="player">Michael McCarron</forge-entity> played 13:32 and had two shots on goal after missing six games with an upper-body injury. … Canadiens defenseman <forge-entity title="Kaiden Guhle" slug="kaiden-guhle-8482087" code="player">Kaiden Guhle</forge-entity> did not play due to illness. … Hutson’s five-game assist streak is the second-longest by a Canadiens rookie defenseman. <forge-entity title="Chris Chelios" slug="chris-chelios-8446053" code="player">Chris Chelios</forge-entity> had a six-game streak in 1984-85.

**Ottawa Senators 2 - 1 Detroit Red Wings**  
Josh Norris was the standout performer for the Ottawa Senators, scoring both goals in a narrow 2-1 victory over the Detroit Red Wings, capped by a dramatic game-winning goal with just 43 seconds remaining. Norris' first goal came from a backhand shot after collecting his own rebound, while his second was a decisive wrist shot from a Drake Batherson pass. The victory halted Ottawa's two-game losing streak, contrasting with Detroit's struggles extending to a four-game skid. Despite outchancing Ottawa 5-on-5 and winning the special teams battle with a 1-for-3 power play record compared to Ottawa's 0-for-5, Detroit failed to secure a point, which left their captain Dylan Larkin expressing frustration at not getting to overtime. Alex DeBrincat's third-period goal for the Red Wings tied the game briefly, and his goal marked his 225th, equaling Matthew Tkachuk's tally among the 2016 NHL Draft class. The game also saw Brady Tkachuk pass Marian Hossa for ninth on Ottawa's all-time assists list, while Red Wings' Lucas Raymond's eight-game point streak came to an end.

**Tampa Bay Lightning 8 - 1 San Jose Sharks**  
The Tampa Bay Lightning dominated the San Jose Sharks with an 8-1 victory, fueled by a stunning five-goal first period, marking the third time this season they've scored eight goals in a game. Brayden Point stood out with four assists in his 600th NHL game, continuing an impressive run with nine points in his past five games. Brandon Hagel contributed two goals as the Lightning executed a rapid scoring burst, including the second-fastest four goals to start a game in their history. Despite good energy in their morning skate, the Sharks struggled from the start, with their goaltender Vitek Vanecek conceding five goals on 12 shots before being replaced by Mackenzie Blackwood. Sharks' standout rookie Macklin Celebrini's five-game point streak ended as the team endured a humbling defeat, though Alexander Wennberg managed a consolation goal in the third period.

**Philadelphia Flyers 5 - 7 Florida Panthers**  
The Florida Panthers triumphed over the Philadelphia Flyers in a thrilling 7-5 victory at the Wells Fargo Center, despite squandering an initial 3-0 lead. Sam Reinhart's late power-play goal secured the win for the Panthers, who were notably successful on special teams, converting four of their five power-play opportunities. Matthew Tkachuk was instrumental with a goal and four assists, extending his point streak to five games. The Flyers mounted a fierce comeback, with Owen Tippett scoring twice within 23 seconds in the third period to tie the game briefly. While both teams showed resilience, key individual milestones included Tkachuk matching his father Keith Tkachuk's record for five-point games by a U.S.-born player and topping nine points across two games, a Panthers first. Rookie Matvei Michkov shone with three assists, a feat not seen for a Flyers teenager since 2016. The game's chaotic nature underscored the Panthers' mixed performance, but also highlighted the hazards and excitement of NHL play.

Playing at Lenovo Center, Svechnikov, who had been scoreless in his last four outings, contributed a goal and three assists, while Martin Necas and Sebastian Aho also played crucial roles with multiple points. Pyotr Kochetkov's key saves helped secure the victory. Despite Valeri Nichushkin's two goals and Cale Makar's two assists, the Avalanche struggled to counter Carolina’s pressure, leading to their third loss in four games. Scott Wedgewood, newly traded from the Nashville Predators, made his Avalanche debut with 30 saves. The Hurricanes’ disciplined 60-minute effort, as highlighted by coach Rod Brind’Amour, was a stark contrast to Colorado's difficulties in adapting to Carolina’s relentless play.
