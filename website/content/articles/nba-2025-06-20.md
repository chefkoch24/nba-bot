**Indiana Pacers 108 - 91 Oklahoma City Thunder**  
In a nail-biting Game 6 of the NBA Finals, the Oklahoma City Thunder, led by coach Mark Daigneault, aim to secure their first NBA title by maintaining a "zero and zero mindset" despite their 3-2 series lead against the Indiana Pacers. Facing a challenging task, the Pacers are relying on collective effort as their All-Star point guard Tyrese Haliburton, hampered by a calf strain, remains uncertain for the game. Indiana coach Rick Carlisle leans on past experience of overcoming a similar deficit against the Knicks. Meanwhile, Oklahoma City's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Jalen Williams have become a formidable duo, combining for over 130 points in Games 4 and 5, with Williams' impressive 40 points in Game 5 capturing national attention. As the Pacers look to rally behind Pascal Siakam's leadership and Indiana's seasoned strategy, the Thunder emphasize a detail-oriented approach, ensuring each moment counts to potentially clinch the title. The game's outcome will depend on the Pacers' ability to counter Oklahoma City's dynamic performances and the readiness of their key players like Haliburton and Siakam to step up in crucial moments.
