In an exciting Game 1 of the first-round playoff series, the New York Knicks overcame a late third-quarter deficit with a remarkable 21-0 run to defeat the Detroit Pistons 123-112.

The Knicks' explosive run turned the game around rapidly, with Payne sparking the run with a three-point play, followed by a pivotal 3-pointer to tie the game, with the Knicks taking a decisive lead within minutes. Detroit, in their first playoff appearance since 2019, initially played with poise and held a 98-90 lead, but their NBA-record, 14-game postseason losing streak continued as the Knicks seized control. Tobias Harris and Cade Cunningham made strong contributions for the Pistons, but New York's defense limited them in key moments. Brunson, who battled an ankle injury late in the season, found his stride after halftime, stating the team never considered giving up. Despite the loss, Harris emphasized the importance of learning from playoff experience for returning stronger.

**Denver Nuggets 112 - 110 LA Clippers**  
In a thrilling game, the Denver Nuggets secured a 112-110 overtime win against the Los Angeles Clippers, thanks largely to Russell Westbrook’s decisive plays in the clutch moments. Former Nuggets coach Michael Malone and GM Calvin Booth’s sudden dismissals seemed to hang over the team, but Westbrook’s familiarity with the Clippers from his previous seasons proved vital. He hit a critical corner 3-pointer to give Denver a late lead in regulation and disrupted an inbounds pass from James Harden in overtime to help clinch the victory. Westbrook's relentless defense contributed to the Clippers’ 20 turnovers, including seven by Kawhi Leonard. Despite shooting struggles, Westbrook’s aggressive play and key contributions helped the Nuggets overcome a 15-point first-half deficit.

James Harden scored 32 points for the Clippers, who entered the playoffs on a strong run, having won 18 of their last 21 games. The Clippers’ coach, Tyronn Lue, highlighted the turnovers as a critical factor in the loss, whereas interim Nuggets coach David Adelman emphasized the team's persistent effort, particularly during a late first-half comeback that set the stage for their win.
