**Carolina Hurricanes 2 - 0 Vancouver Canucks**  
Tokarski makes 14 saves, Hurricanes shut out Canucks
 **RALEIGH, N.C. --** <forge-entity title="Dustin Tokarski" slug="dustin-tokarski-8474682" code="player">Dustin Tokarski</forge-entity> made 14 saves for the Carolina Hurricanes in a 2-0 win against the Vancouver Canucks at Lenovo Center on Friday. 
The shutout was Tokarski's first in five starts with Carolina and the third of his career. The 35-year-old was signed by the Hurricanes on Dec. 2 after playing for Chicago of the American Hockey League.

<forge-entity title="Jordan Staal" slug="jordan-staal-8473533" code="player">Jordan Staal</forge-entity> had a goal and an assist, and <forge-entity title="Andrei Svechnikov" slug="andrei-svechnikov-8480830" code="player">Andrei Svechnikov</forge-entity> scored for the Hurricanes (26-15-2), who are 4-2-0 in their past six.

“It was a weird game. Not a lot going on," Carolina coach Rod Brind'Amour said. “It’s a lot of hockey. I think it’s a product of that too. You could see the tank was on ‘E.’ But I thought we dug in, and a couple plays were the difference in the game.” 
It was the third straight multipoint game for Staal, who had a hat trick in a 6-3 win against the Toronto Maple Leafs on Thursday.

<forge-entity title="Thatcher Demko" slug="thatcher-demko-8477967" code="player">Thatcher Demko</forge-entity> made 18 saves for the Canucks (18-13-10), who are 0-2-2 in their past four. Demko missed the previous three games with back spasms.

“I don’t think (Carolina) had a lot; they were tired,” Vancouver coach Rick Tocchet said. “We had a lot of o-zone time. (But if) you miss the net or you don’t shoot on 2-on-1s, it’s hard to win.”

<forge-entity title="Elias Pettersson" slug="elias-pettersson-8480012" code="player">Elias Pettersson</forge-entity> returned to the Vancouver lineup after missing six games with an upper-body injury sustained against the San Jose Sharks on Dec. 23.

“I felt pretty good,” Pettersson said. “Maybe some puck battles – puck losses – I do want back. But overall it felt good.”

The Hurricanes took a 1-0 lead at 14:41 of the first period. <forge-entity title="Dmitry Orlov" slug="dmitry-orlov-8475200" code="player">Dmitry Orlov</forge-entity>’s shot hit <forge-entity title="Eric Robinson" slug="eric-robinson-8480762" code="player">Eric Robinson</forge-entity> at the netfront, and Staal scored on the loose puck in the slot.

“On both sides, it was kind of a sloppier game,” Staal said. “In those games, it’s always nice to be in the lead and grind it out that way.” 
The Hurricanes outshot the Canucks 7-5 in the first period.

“I thought we had a good first period, whether they played the night before or not,” Vancouver defenseman <forge-entity title="Tyler Myers" slug="tyler-myers-8474574" code="player">Tyler Myers</forge-entity> said. “We did some good things, but (there are) some things to clean up. To get some more pucks to the net, some more bodies to the net, would help our group.”

Svechnikov made it 2-0 at 1:37 of the second period when he spun away from a check from <forge-entity title="Carson Soucy" slug="carson-soucy-8477369" code="player">Carson Soucy</forge-entity> in the corner before driving to the net and scoring top shelf.

Tokarski improved to 4-1-0 with a 2.00 goals-against average and a .907 save percentage.

“The guys are playing well right now. The goose egg is just the cherry on top,” Tokarski said. “That’s a good team on the other side, and the guys limited them tonight and made my job easy. So it was a lot of fun.”

**NOTES:** The combined 34 shots were the fewest in an NHL game this season. … Vancouver’s 14 shots were a season-low. … Pettersson was minus-1 in 20:27. … Staal has eight points (five goals, three assists) in a four-game point streak. … The Hurricanes are 0-for-17 on the power play in the past six games.

**Winnipeg Jets 1 - 2 Los Angeles Kings**  
In a thrilling overtime encounter, Adrian Kempe secured a 2-1 victory for the Los Angeles Kings against the Winnipeg Jets, marking the Kings' fifth consecutive win. The victory came just 1:14 into overtime at Canada Life Centre, with Kempe's impressive high wrist shot from a 2-on-1 play alongside Anze Kopitar. Notably, Kempe continued his scoring streak to four games, while the Kings extended their point streak to six games.

Alex Turcotte also scored for the Kings, while Darcy Kuemper's crucial saves, including one against Kyle Connor's late attempt, helped maintain the lead. Kuemper's performance contributes to his undefeated streak in 10 games. Mark Scheifele leveled the game with a power-play goal in the third period for the Jets, who struggled with recent form, losing four of their last five games. Despite the fierce competition, both teams acknowledged the broader humanitarian challenges affecting L.A., highlighting sportsmanship amid adversity.

**Utah Hockey Club 2 - 1 San Jose Sharks**  
In a thrilling finish, Barrett Hayton's goal with just 1:32 left in regulation secured the Utah Hockey Club's 2-1 victory over the San Jose Sharks at Delta Center. Hayton capitalized on his own rebound, firing the puck over Sharks' goalie Alexandar Georgiev's glove from the top of the circle. Nick Schmaltz also scored for Utah, and Karel Vejmelka made 18 saves, helping the team snap a losing streak. The Sharks scored early with Fabian Zetterlund's goal, assisted by Mikael Granlund, but Georgiev's 23 saves weren't enough to prevent the Sharks' second straight loss. A potential go-ahead goal by Clayton Keller for Utah was overturned for goaltender interference following a video review, adding to the excitement of the match.
