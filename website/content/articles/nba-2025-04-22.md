**Denver Nuggets 102 - 105 LA Clippers**  
In a thrilling opener to their Western Conference quarterfinal series, the Denver Nuggets edged out the Los Angeles Clippers 112-110 in overtime, despite the Clippers' strong start and defensive strategies. Kawhi Leonard led the Clippers with 22 points, and the team excelled at controlling the tempo, especially in the first half, scoring 36 points in the paint. However, turnovers became their Achilles' heel, with Leonard contributing seven out of the Clippers' 20. The Nuggets, on the other hand, capitalized on the Clippers' mistakes and saw standout performances from Nikola Jokic, who nearly notched a triple-double, and Russell Westbrook, whose timely 3-pointer and crucial defensive play were pivotal in the waning moments. Michael Porter Jr.'s lack of involvement became a talking point, with interim head coach David Adelman opting to keep him benched during critical junctures, highlighting Denver's reliance on defense. The Clippers, while acknowledging their missteps, remain confident and look to bounce back in Game 2, mindful of their ability to dictate plays when focused.
