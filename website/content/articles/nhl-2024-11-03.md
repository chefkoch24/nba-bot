**Florida Panthers 4 - 2 Dallas Stars**  
The Florida Panthers wrapped up their successful stint at the 2024 NHL Global Series Finland by sweeping the Dallas Stars with a 4-2 victory at Nokia Arena in Tampere. A.J. Greer, a new addition to the Panthers, scored the decisive goal early in the third period, capitalizing on a face-off win by Tomas Nosek. This win marks Florida's fifth consecutive victory, thanks in part to stellar performances by several players, including Spencer Knight with 23 saves and contributions from nine different players earning points. Finnish star Aleksander Barkov, along with other Finnish teammates, delivered strong performances, making the experience in his hometown even more memorable. Matt Duchene stood out for Dallas, scoring a goal and an assist, but the Stars fell short, leaving them winless in the two-game series. The series was marked by a celebratory atmosphere, notably highlighted by Finnish players from both teams starting the game on the ice together and the local crowd's enthusiastic rendition of the national anthem, forming lasting memories for all involved despite the tough competition. Sam Reinhart's ongoing scoring prowess was another highlight, as he quickly reached 21 points for the season, making franchise history.

**Philadelphia Flyers 0 - 3 Boston Bruins**  
Korpisalo makes 20 saves, Bruins shut out Flyers
 **PHILADELPHIA --** <forge-entity title="Joonas Korpisalo" slug="joonas-korpisalo-8476914" code="player">Joonas Korpisalo</forge-entity> made 20 saves for the Boston Bruins in a 3-0 win against the Philadelphia Flyers at Wells Fargo Center on Saturday. 
<forge-entity title="Brad Marchand" slug="brad-marchand-8473419" code="player">Brad Marchand</forge-entity> had a goal and an assist for Boston (5-6-1), and <forge-entity title="Matthew Poitras" slug="matthew-poitras-8483505" code="player">Matthew Poitras</forge-entity> and <forge-entity title="Justin Brazeau" slug="justin-brazeau-8479638" code="player">Justin Brazeau</forge-entity> scored. It was the Bruins' first win in three games (1-2-0).

"Big game today," Korpisalo said. "We took the driver's seat right away, and we kept it. And those are a full good 60 minutes."

Aleksei Kolosov made 20 saves for Philadelphia (4-7-1) after replacing <forge-entity title="Samuel Ersson" slug="samuel-ersson-8481035" code="player">Samuel Ersson</forge-entity> at 7:36 of the first period. Ersson left the game because of a lower-body injury after stopping all eight shots he faced. The Flyers did not have a timetable for when Ersson could play again.

"\[Kolosov\] made some big saves, he kept us in it," Flyers captain <forge-entity title="Sean Couturier" slug="sean-couturier-8476461" code="player">Sean Couturier</forge-entity> said. "They were outshooting us most of the game and he kept us in there, gave us a chance and that's what you want from your goalie."

The Bruins got a strong effort from their goalie. It was Korpisalo's first shutout since joining the Bruins in a trade that sent <forge-entity title="Linus Ullmark" slug="linus-ullmark-8476999" code="player">Linus Ullmark</forge-entity>, the 2023 Vezina Trophy winner as the top goalie in the NHL, to the Ottawa Senators on June 24. 
He was at his best in the second period when he made seven saves, including a sliding shoulder stop on <forge-entity title="Morgan Frost" slug="morgan-frost-8480028" code="player">Morgan Frost</forge-entity> during a 2-on-1 rush with 3:41 remaining in the period.

"In every game there's going to be timely saves, and you've got to be ready to do those," Korpisalo said.

It's the second straight start where Korpisalo has allowed one goal or fewer; he allowed one on 18 shots in the Bruins' 2-0 loss to the Flyers in Boston on Tuesday.

"You can see him get more and more confident," Bruins coach Jim Montgomery said. "When you see a goalie really be square and compact to the puck, not a lot of movement, you know he's finding his groove."

Korpisalo certainly has earned the trust of his teammates.

"He's just so athletic and moves so well," Poitras said. "You see some of those saves where he's coming across the net so fast and making those glove saves. He was huge for us tonight, and he's just so athletic."

Poitras put the Bruins ahead 1-0 at 13:28 of the first period. <forge-entity title="Hampus Lindholm" slug="hampus-lindholm-8476854" code="player">Hampus Lindholm</forge-entity>'s point shot rebounded off the end wall to Poitras, who slid a shot from a sharp angle between Kolosov's skates. 
It was his first goal since Nov. 27, 2023, in part because of season-ending shoulder surgery in February.

"It felt good to just see one go in the net," he said. "Obviously it wasn't pretty. Just put pucks on net and good things happen."

Brazeau made it 2-0 at 11:23 of the second period when he skated through the slot and one-timed a pass from Marchand past Kolosov.

"The 5-on-5 goals that we got are the kind of 5-on-5 goals that we're going to have to score, where it's at the goal line, we outnumber people, and we find someone in the slot and or we crash the net," Montgomery said.  
  
Marchand closed the scoring at 16:21 of the third period with an empty-net goal for the 3-0 final.

It's the third straight game the Flyers have had 21 shots on goal or fewer. Part of that could be a focus on playing better in the defensive zone.

"We have to play well in front of our goalies," Flyers coach John Tortorella said. "To me, when you play well in front of your goalies, you have the puck more. So as far as the shots, I think we have chances to shoot and we don't. Like I said the other day, it's an epidemic of shooting the puck wide. ... Playing defense has to be a priority for us in the situation we're having, our goaltending situation, and just where we are as a team. Offense comes off of that. Hopefully it's a matter of getting some guys going."

**NOTES:** The win was Montgomery's 117th as Bruins coach, tying Lynn Patrick for 10th all-time. ... Korpisalo's last shutout was April 10, 2023, with the Los Angeles Kings.

**Los Angeles Kings 3 - 4 Chicago Blackhawks**  
In an exciting match, Tyler Bertuzzi dramatically tied the game for the Chicago Blackhawks with just 31 seconds left in regulation, setting up a thrilling 4-3 shootout victory over the Los Angeles Kings at Crypto.com Arena. The Blackhawks, who snapped a four-game losing streak by winning two of their last three games, saw Connor Bedard, Teuvo Teravainen, and Ryan Donato excel in the shootout, supported by Petr Mrazek's 37 crucial saves. Despite Alex Laferriere’s standout performance for the Kings, scoring twice to extend his streak to four goals in three games, the team couldn't hold their early lead, faltering in a rare home loss despite Darcy Kuemper's efforts in goal. The resilience of the Blackhawks, guided by veteran leadership from Nick Foligno, was praised by coach Luke Richardson as the team rallied in the third period, underscoring their determination to reverse early-season setbacks.

**Washington Capitals 7 - 2 Columbus Blue Jackets**  
In a dominant performance, the Washington Capitals defeated the Columbus Blue Jackets 7-2 at Capital One Arena, led by Alex Ovechkin's goal and two assists, marking his third consecutive multi-point game. Ovechkin, who now has 859 career NHL goals, is closing in on Wayne Gretzky's all-time record of 894 goals, needing 36 more to surpass it. The Capitals set the pace by scoring five goals in the first period, with Connor McMichael netting two and Dylan Strome contributing a goal and two assists. Logan Thompson's 34 saves helped secure Washington's six straight home win. For Columbus, Damon Severson and Kevin Labanc scored, but early defensive lapses led to the team's downfall, as noted by coach Dean Evason. Strome has continued to be a key player for the Capitals, leading in assists and maintaining a consistent scoring presence throughout the season.

**Ottawa Senators 3 - 0 Seattle Kraken**  
Forsberg makes 22 saves, Senators shut out Kraken
 **OTTAWA --** <forge-entity title="Anton Forsberg" slug="anton-forsberg-8476341" code="player">Anton Forsberg</forge-entity> made 22 saves for the Ottawa Senators in a 3-0 win against the Seattle Kraken at Canadian Tire Centre on Saturday. 
It was Forsberg’s second shutout in three starts. He is the first goaltender to record multiple shutouts this season.

“From Day 1, we really believed in 'Forsy,' even when he had a couple games that probably weren’t his best,” Ottawa coach Travis Green said. “He played great. I’m happy for him. He had a stint there where he probably wasn’t happy with his game for a couple games, but after Linus \[Ullmark\] got hurt, he’s really found his groove and that was another great game tonight.” 
<forge-entity title="Tim Stutzle" slug="tim-stutzle-8482116" code="player">Tim Stutzle</forge-entity> had a goal and an assist, and <forge-entity title="Brady Tkachuk" slug="brady-tkachuk-8480801" code="player">Brady Tkachuk</forge-entity> and <forge-entity title="Adam Gaudette" slug="adam-gaudette-8478874" code="player">Adam Gaudette</forge-entity> scored for the Senators (6-5-0), who are 5-1-0 at home this season. Ottawa was coming off a 2-1 loss to the New York Rangers on Friday.

“It was super nice to see the bounceback we had tonight from yesterday,” Forsberg said. “It was a tough loss yesterday. We played real well. And we come back in here again today and worked real hard. It was impressive.”

<forge-entity title="Philipp Grubauer" slug="philipp-grubauer-8475831" code="player">Philipp Grubauer</forge-entity> made 20 saves for the Kraken (5-6-1), who were 0-for-4 on the power play.

“We lacked execution,” Seattle forward <forge-entity title="Jordan Eberle" slug="jordan-eberle-8474586" code="player">Jordan Eberle</forge-entity> said. “We were having a tough time making passes tape to tape. The biggest thing I see is just a lack of battle level. We need to ramp that up. We have a whole other level that we need to get to here.

“I see, like, 1-on-1 battles, stick battles, 50-50 pucks — those have to be won. I understand you’re not going to win all of them all game, but you have to win the majority of them to give yourself a chance to win. Whether it’s wall plays coming out of the \[defensive\] zone, whether it’s stuff around the net, whether it’s just executing on the power play, that stuff all needs to be fixed up.” 
Gaudette scored on a loose puck at the edge of the crease to give the Senators a 1-0 lead at 5:28 of the first period. The goal was initially waved off for goaltender interference, but Ottawa challenged and the call on the ice was overturned.

“I didn’t like the response after the \[first\] goal against there,” Kraken coach Dan Bylsma said. “I thought our play dipped for a considerable \[amount of\] time after they got the call, after they got the goal. Really, we were never able to take the speed and the pace of the game to Ottawa as a result.”

It was Gaudette’s sixth goal in five games.

“I’ve been fired up for a couple years now,” Gaudette said of playing the majority of his previous two seasons in the American Hockey League. “But, you know, that whole journey is a learning experience. I learned a lot and I knew I could battle my way back and now it’s just about staying here.”

Tkachuk tipped a <forge-entity title="Jacob Bernard-Docker" slug="jacob-bernard-docker-8480879" code="player">Jacob Bernard-Docker</forge-entity> point shot to make it 2-0 at 11:11 of the second period. The Senators captain has seven goals in his past eight games.

“We’re sick of the continuous cycle that we’ve been on, since I’ve been here, of going home early and ‘shoulda, coulda, wouldas’ throughout the whole year,” Tkachuk said. “I think, for us, it’s just that this year’s different; this year’s mindset is different. We want more. We want more from ourselves, each other. But the great thing about this group is the belief we have in one another.” 
Forsberg slid across to make a toe save on Eberle on a rush at 5:07 of the third period.

“We’re obviously a young team, but we’ve got more experience than before, in the past,” Forsberg said. “Everybody’s hungry. We know how it’s been before, and no one wants to be in the same situation again. Everyone’s really motivated to make a hard push for the playoffs here.”

Stutzle scored into an empty net for the 3-0 final at 17:46 of the third period.

“Honestly, I felt like I really didn’t have my legs tonight, especially on the rush, like, every time I was trying to go 1-on-1 I didn’t really have the legs,” Stutzle said. “But those are those nights when you’ve just got to keep it simple and stick with it, and I think that’s what we did.”

**NOTES:** Ottawa coach Travis Green is 3-for-3 in coach’s challenges this season. … Tkachuk had a game-high seven hits.

**Detroit Red Wings 2 - 1 Buffalo Sabres**

All the goals were scored during power plays, with Larkin equalizing in the second period after earlier losing the puck, which led to Alex Tuch's short-handed goal for the Sabres. Larkin then secured the win with a second goal, assisted by Alex DeBrincat. Goaltender Cam Talbot played a crucial role, making 31 saves and effectively frustrating Buffalo's attempts to score in the game's closing moments.

**Pittsburgh Penguins 3 - 1 Montreal Canadiens**  
Sidney Crosby's scoring resurgence continued as he netted two goals for the second consecutive game, leading the Pittsburgh Penguins to a 3-1 victory over the Montreal Canadiens. Crosby, who had recently broken a six-game goal drought, contributed to a power-play goal to help secure Pittsburgh's second straight win after a six-game losing streak. Kris Letang marked a milestone by playing in his 1,100th NHL game, with an assist, while Alex Nedeljkovic stood firm in the net, making 25 saves. Despite Christian Dvorak's goal breaking through for Montreal, the Canadiens struggled offensively, unable to capitalize on their power-play opportunities, and have now dropped three consecutive games. Notably, the game saw Crosby surpass Marcel Dionne with his 216th go-ahead goal, placing him eighth in NHL history, while Blake Lizotte sealed the win with an empty-net goal. Montreal coach Martin St-Louis recognized the team's improvement, despite the lack of points, and emphasized the importance of maintaining their current form.

**St Louis Blues 4 - 2 Toronto Maple Leafs**  
In a thrilling matchup at the Enterprise Center, the St. Louis Blues delivered a 4-2 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs, spoiling former coach Craig Berube’s return. Colton Parayko was instrumental, contributing two goals and an assist, all in the second period, which marked a turning point for the Blues. The win ended a three-game losing streak for the Blues, aided by strong performances from Jordan Kyrou, who scored his first goal in 11 games, and Ryan Suter, who provided two assists. Despite being outshot in the opening period, St. Louis took control in the second, with Jordan Binnington making 35 saves to match Jake Allen for the second-most wins in Blues history. The game featured notable moments such as a lower-body injury to Blues defenseman Philip Broberg and a video tribute to Berube, receiving a warm ovation from the sellout crowd. Meanwhile, Mitch Marner extended his point streak to four games, though teammate John Tavares saw his streak snapped.
