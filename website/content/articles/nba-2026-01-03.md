**Indiana Pacers 113 - 123 San Antonio Spurs**  
The San Antonio Spurs secured a 123-113 victory over the Indiana Pacers, marking their first win since Victor Wembanyama injured his left knee. De’Aaron Fox led the Spurs with 24 points, supported by Dylan Harper and Stephon Castle, who added 22 and 19 points respectively.

Despite shooting 51% from the field, the Pacers were outmatched by the Spurs' efficiency at the free-throw line, making 22 of 28 attempts. San Antonio maintained control throughout the game, extending their lead early in the third quarter and withstanding Indiana's late rally. The Spurs next face Portland on Saturday, while the Pacers will visit Orlando on Sunday.

The Washington Wizards cruised to a 119-99 victory over the Brooklyn Nets, highlighted by Justin Champagnie's season-high 20 points.

Noteworthy aspects of the game included the Wizards' dominance in rebounding, outpacing the Nets 51-33, and limiting Brooklyn to a mere six successful three-point attempts out of 29.

Matas Buzelis was instrumental in the comeback, scoring 17 of his 21 points during the second half, alongside nine rebounds and a season-high seven assists.

The game featured 19 lead changes, and despite leading by 13 points in the first quarter, the Magic couldn't hold their advantage as the Bulls tied at 59 by halftime and ultimately triumphed in a tight contest.

In a thrilling finish, Giannis Antetokounmpo delivered a game-winning dunk with 4.7 seconds left on a lob from Kevin Porter Jr., securing a 122-121 victory for the Milwaukee Bucks against the Charlotte Hornets.

Despite Zion Williamson's 35-point performance, the Pelicans couldn't avoid a sixth consecutive loss, significantly missing the contributions of key injured players like Saddiq Bey and Trey Murphy III.

The Golden State Warriors aim to extend their recent home-court success as they host the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday in San Francisco. The Warriors have won five of their last six games and are on a home winning streak, having recently defeated teams like the Phoenix Suns, Orlando Magic, and Dallas Mavericks.

This game also marks a homecoming for Thunder's emerging star Jalen Williams, who played at Santa Clara, and he'll face another Santa Clara alum, Warriors guard Brandin Podziemski. Williams has been impressive beyond scoring, contributing significantly to the Thunder's recent success, while Podziemski has consistently scored in double figures. Both teams have key players shining in different aspects, with the Thunder's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander previously outpacing Warriors' Stephen Curry in head-to-head matchups this season.

**Los Angeles Lakers 126 - 116 Memphis Grizzlies**  
In a clash between the struggling Los Angeles Lakers and Memphis Grizzlies, both teams looked to rectify their recent downturns. The Lakers, having lost four of their last five games, hoped to rebound despite missing key players Austin Reaves and Rui Hachimura due to calf injuries. Their recent 128-106 defeat to the Detroit Pistons highlighted their struggles, with Luka Doncic scoring 30 points but also contributing eight turnovers in a game where Los Angeles's 21 turnovers led to 30 Pistons points.
