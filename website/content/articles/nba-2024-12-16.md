**Los Angeles Lakers 116 - 110 Memphis Grizzlies**  
In a highly anticipated matchup, the Los Angeles Lakers are set to face the Memphis Grizzlies, with Lakers star Anthony Davis emphasizing the need for toughness following their 97-87 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves. Davis, who posted 23 points and 11 rebounds but also committed four of the team's 22 turnovers, aims for a cleaner and more physical game.

The Grizzlies, on a hot streak with an 11-3 record in their last 14 games, are thriving off their depth and defensive improvements, highlighted by a recent 135-119 win over the Nets led by Ja Morant's 28 points, 7 rebounds, and 10 assists.
