**Florida Panthers 6 - 0 Carolina Hurricanes**  
Panthers score 6 again, blank Hurricanes for home-and-home sweep
 **SUNRISE --** The Florida Panthers scored four goals in the third period to pull away from the Carolina Hurricanes for the second straight day, 6-0 at Amerant Bank Arena on Saturday. 
“It was good. The first was tight, but as each period went on, I thought we got stronger,” Florida coach Paul Maurice said.

The Panthers, who defeated the Hurricanes 6-3 in Raleigh, North Carolina, on Friday, completed the home-and-home sweep.

<forge-entity title="Spencer Knight" slug="spencer-knight-8481519" code="player">Spencer Knight</forge-entity> made 20 saves for his first shutout of the season and his fourth in the NHL.

“We just love to play for each other,” Knight said. “If someone makes a mistake, we just pick them up and keep moving forward. That’s the kind of love we have in this room, and I think that allows us to play really hard and really free.”

<forge-entity title="Sam Bennett" slug="sam-bennett-8477935" code="player">Sam Bennett</forge-entity> scored in his third straight game, and <forge-entity title="Aleksander Barkov" slug="aleksander-barkov-8477493" code="player">Aleksander Barkov</forge-entity> had a goal and an assist for Florida (15-9-1), which scored three goals in a 1:24 span in the third and has won three in a row. <forge-entity title="Matthew Tkachuk" slug="matthew-tkachuk-8479314" code="player">Matthew Tkachuk</forge-entity> had two assists. 
<forge-entity title="Spencer Martin" slug="spencer-martin-8477484" code="player">Spencer Martin</forge-entity> allowed five goals on 28 shots for Carolina (16-7-1). <forge-entity title="Yaniv Perets" slug="yaniv-perets-8484293" code="player">Yaniv Perets</forge-entity> stopped six of seven shots in relief after replacing Martin midway through the third.

“We have to shelf this one. The games keep coming,” Carolina coach Rod Brind’Amour said. “Turn the page. We are always focusing on the next day and you learn from it. This is good. We have to take our medicine here; knock us down a few notches and get regrouped, start again. We have a great team, we know that. When you don’t play as a team, don’t do the little things, this is what happens.’’

<forge-entity title="Aaron Ekblad" slug="aaron-ekblad-8477932" code="player">Aaron Ekblad</forge-entity> gave the Panthers a 1-0 lead at 6:42 of the second period. After a scramble at the net, Ekblad scored on a sharp-angled wrist shot over Martin, who was still on the ice struggling to get back up on his skates.

It was Ekblad’s first regular-season goal since scoring against the Ottawa Senators on Feb. 20, 2024.

“Obviously it is nice that pucks are going in,’’ said Ekblad, who had two assists in Friday’s win at Carolina. “But it is our structure and how we play that gives us those opportunities.”

<forge-entity title="Mackie Samoskevich" slug="mackie-samoskevich-8482713" code="player">Mackie Samoskevich</forge-entity> made it 2-0 in the final second of the second period with a power-play goal. Barkov sent a sharp pass from the top of the left circle to Tkachuk on the right side of the goal post. Tkachuk then sent the puck across the goalmouth to a waiting Samoskevich, who knocked it into the open net.

“That was a rocket pass, he had no time but has the hand strength and skills to finish that,” Maurice said. “Real good spot for him.” 
Bennett extended it to 3-0 at 8:19 of the third. <forge-entity title="Anton Lundell" slug="anton-lundell-8482113" code="player">Anton Lundell</forge-entity> forced a turnover in the Carolina zone and got it to <forge-entity title="Eetu Luostarinen" slug="eetu-luostarinen-8480185" code="player">Eetu Luostarinen</forge-entity>, who drove in and sent a cross-ice pass to Bennett for his 12th goal of the season.

Florida then scored three goals in a span of 1:24 to push it to 6-0.

“It was fairly even, then we were behind, and never really got going from there,” Brind’Amour said. “It was fairly even after two, but it fell apart on us in the third.’’

Barkov made it 4-0 at 11:37 with a power-play goal on a cross-ice pass from Tkachuk. <forge-entity title="Adam Boqvist" slug="adam-boqvist-8480871" code="player">Adam Boqvist</forge-entity> then scored his first goal with the Panthers 11 seconds later, driving in and beating Martin on the backhand off the rush to extend it to 5-0.

<forge-entity title="Evan Rodrigues" slug="evan-rodrigues-8478542" code="player">Evan Rodrigues</forge-entity> scored on the power play to make it 6-0 at 13:01 after deflecting a point shot from <forge-entity title="Nate Schmidt" slug="nate-schmidt-8477220" code="player">Nate Schmidt</forge-entity> past Perets.

“Obviously, we got beat in every aspect. There was not a whole lot of positive out there,” Hurricanes captain <forge-entity title="Jordan Staal" slug="jordan-staal-8473533" code="player">Jordan Staal</forge-entity> said. “We didn’t do a good enough job of breaking the puck out, moving the puck forward, and playing in their end.’’

**NOTES:** The shutout was Knight’s first since Nov. 9, 2022, when he made 40 saves in a 3-0 win against the Hurricanes. He spent all of last season playing for Florida’s American Hockey League affiliate in Charlotte, N.C. … Samoskevich became the fourth player in the NHL this season to score a goal in the final second of a period, joining Noah Hanifin (second period, Nov. 2), Rasmus Dahlin (third period, Nov. 23), and Rickard Rakell (second period, Nov. 29). … Barkov recorded his 146th career power-play assist, tying Jonathan Huberdeau for most in franchise history.

**Tampa Bay Lightning 3 - 5 Toronto Maple Leafs**  
In Auston Matthews' return from a nine-game absence due to an upper-body injury, the Toronto Maple Leafs secured a 5-3 victory over the Tampa Bay Lightning at Amalie Arena. Matthews contributed two assists and excelled in face-offs, winning 16 out of 24, while Matthew Knies opened the scoring for Toronto with a deflection goal. Chris Tanev, Nicholas Robertson, and John Tavares each added to the Maple Leafs' tally, with Robertson highlighting his first goal of the season. Victor Hedman set a new Lightning franchise record with his 590th career assist, though Tampa Bay was missing their leading scorer, Nikita Kucherov, due to injury. Despite efforts from the Lightning, including a power-play goal from Cam Atkinson and a late empty-net goal by William Nylander for Toronto sealing the win, they fell short. The victory marked Toronto's fifth in six games, aided by stellar goaltending from Joseph Woll, who made 38 saves. The Leafs maintain a perfect record when leading after two periods this season, while Maple Leafs forward Mitch Marner extended his point streak to six games.

**New Jersey Devils 5 - 6 Washington Capitals**  
In an exhilarating finish, the Washington Capitals edged past the New Jersey Devils 6-5, highlighted by two quick goals from Taylor Raddysh and Pierre-Luc Dubois within a ten-second span late in the third period. Raddysh's deflection at 13:54 gave the Capitals a lead, while Dubois capitalized on a puck stolen from goalie Jake Allen to extend it, with valuable assists from Aliaksei Protas and John Carlson, who tallied three assists in the game. Despite a power-play goal that brought the Devils within one, the Capitals, buoyed by a proficient power play going 3-for-5, secured their fourth consecutive victory. Offensively, Connor McMichael, Jakob Chychrun, and Rasmus Sandin also contributed with goals, while Charlie Lindgren made 22 critical saves for Washington. The Devils, with standout performances from Jack Hughes and Stefan Noesen, who scored twice, saw their rally fall short, reflecting on the impact of penalties and the absence of Tomas Tatar due to injury. This victory adds to Washington’s strong momentum, noted by head coach Spencer Carbery as significant given the team's back-to-back challenge and Alex Ovechkin's absence.

This marked Michkov’s third overtime game-winner, tying him with notable players like Sidney Crosby and Ilya Kovalchuk for the most overtime goals by a teenager in NHL history. The rookie's impressive performance, alongside strong plays from Owen Tippett and Tyson Foerster, contributed to the Flyers' third consecutive win. Despite a late effort from the Blues, including a game-tying power-play goal by Jake Neighbours, the Flyers maintained their streak, thanks also to notable saves by goaltender Aleksei Kolosov.

It was his first shutout since Nov. 25, 2023, when he made 40 saves in a 1-0 shootout loss to the Philadelphia Flyers.

“I don’t remember when my last shutout was,” Sorokin said. “It was a long time ago. Thanks to the guys for fighting until the end. It was a great win today.”

<forge-entity title="Simon Holmstrom" slug="simon-holmstrom-8481601" code="player">Simon Holmstrom</forge-entity> scored twice for the second straight game, and <forge-entity title="Anders Lee" slug="anders-lee-8475314" code="player">Anders Lee</forge-entity> had a goal and an assist for the Islanders (9-10-6), who had lost three straight. They lost 5-4 in overtime to the Washington Capitals on Friday.

“It feels good. It definitely feels good,” New York coach <forge-entity title="Patrick Roy" slug="patrick-roy-8451033" code="player">Patrick Roy</forge-entity> said. “I thought we played strong for 60 minutes from the start to the end. Our power play scored a big goal for us. Our penalty-killing was really good, and we were outstanding at 5-on-6. We had a huge save at the start of the third period, and I thought that was the key to the game.” 
<forge-entity title="James Reimer" slug="james-reimer-8473503" code="player">James Reimer</forge-entity> made 17 saves for the Sabres (11-11-2), who were shut out for the second time in three games and lost their third in a row, including a 4-3 overtime loss to the Vancouver Canucks on Friday.

“We couldn’t just quite corral the puck around the net,” Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff said. “I thought, again, we missed the net quite often. That didn’t allow a second opportunity. I think the one that probably hurt us the most was the late 2-on-1.”

<forge-entity title="Matt Martin" slug="matt-martin-8474709" code="player">Matt Martin</forge-entity> appeared to give New York a 1-0 lead at 12:45 of the first period, but the goal was overturned after Buffalo challenged for offside.

Holmstrom extended the lead to 2-0 at 9:28 on a 2-on-1 when he converted a cross-ice pass from Lee in the right face-off circle.

“We just gave them what they were looking for,” Sabres forward <forge-entity title="Dylan Cozens" slug="dylan-cozens-8481528" code="player">Dylan Cozens</forge-entity> said. “We came out flat. Our execution was terrible. And we played right into their hand and did exactly what they wanted us to do.” 
With the Sabres on a short-handed 2-on-1, Sorokin made a blocker save while in a split to stop Cozens’ one-timer from the left circle at 1:11 of the third period.

“That's a big point of the game,” Islanders defenseman <forge-entity title="Ryan Pulock" slug="ryan-pulock-8477506" code="player">Ryan Pulock</forge-entity> said. “I mean, we're on the power play, and that happens. That's a key moment in the game. Heck of a save by \[Sorokin\], and that allowed us to stay in it and find another gear after that.”

Later in the third, Buffalo forward <forge-entity title="Alex Tuch" slug="alex-tuch-8477949" code="player">Alex Tuch</forge-entity> made a move to the front of the net, but Sorokin kicked out the left pad to deny the backhand try at 7:46.

Holmstrom scored into an empty net at 19:52 for his second goal of the game and the 3-0 final.

“We wanted to have to go face it,” Lee, the Islanders captain, said of his team holding on to a third-period lead after often struggling to do this season; New York had lost six of its previous seven games and blown a lead in the third in five of those losses. “We wanted to go right after it. We did exactly what we wanted to do. Go get a two-goal lead, and let’s finish it off. Let’s go right after this thing.”

**Minnesota Wild 3 - 2 Nashville Predators**
