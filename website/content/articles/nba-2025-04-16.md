**Orlando Magic 120 - 95 Atlanta Hawks**  
The Orlando Magic secured the No. 7 seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs, setting up a play-in match against the Atlanta Hawks to earn a first-round series with the defending champion Boston Celtics. The Magic and Hawks split their season series 2-2, with both sides winning a game on the opponent's court. Orlando, finishing atop the Southeast Division following a strong 9-3 run to end the regular season, relies heavily on Paolo Banchero, who averaged 28.2 points per game over that stretch. Both Banchero and Franz Wagner contributed significantly after recovering from midseason injuries. Atlanta finished as the eighth seed, positioning them for their fourth consecutive play-in tourney appearance. With Trae Young's strong performances in their final road games, the Hawks will rely on his offensive skills in what is expected to be a defensively focused game against Orlando. The Magic, participating in the play-in for the first time, are seen as a formidable defensive team, while the Hawks have often succeeded offensively, suggesting a clash of styles in their upcoming matchup.

**Golden State Warriors 121 - 116 Memphis Grizzlies**  
The Golden State Warriors secured the seventh seed by acquiring Jimmy Butler at the trade deadline, aiming for a top-six playoff spot in the Western Conference. Despite Butler's impactful performance, helping the team achieve a 23-7 record in games he played, the Warriors (48-34) ended one game short of the automatic berth, landing in the play-in tournament. The Warriors now face the eighth-seeded Memphis Grizzlies in San Francisco, with the winner earning the No. 7 playoff spot to face the Houston Rockets. Veteran players Stephen Curry, Jimmy Butler, and Draymond Green are leading the Warriors' playoff charge, though concerns about rebounding and rest persist. Curry continues to defy age with impressive stats, including 311 3-pointers this season. The Grizzlies, under interim coach Tuomas Iisalo after firing Taylor Jenkins, boast a resilient squad, demonstrated by a 132-97 victory over the Dallas Mavericks in their season finale, and look to prove doubters wrong. Golden State holds a 3-1 advantage over Memphis this season, but the Grizzlies' past dominant victory showcases the unpredictability of their matchup.
