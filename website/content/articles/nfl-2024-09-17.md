**Philadelphia Eagles 21 - 22 Atlanta Falcons**  
In a dramatic Monday night showdown, Kirk Cousins led the Atlanta Falcons to a 22-21 comeback victory over the Philadelphia Eagles. Despite a shaky performance in the season opener and recovering from a torn Achilles tendon, Cousins completed a game-winning drive with a 7-yard touchdown pass to Drake London with just 34 seconds remaining. Atlanta, which invested $180 million in Cousins, saw their quarterback deliver crucial plays down the stretch, including completions to Darnell Mooney and the decisive touchdown to London. The Eagles, led by Jalen Hurts, had a chance to secure the game but faltered due to a dropped pass by Saquon Barkley and soft defensive coverage. Cousins finished 20 of 29 for 241 yards and two touchdowns, while Hurts threw for 183 yards and a touchdown but was intercepted in the final moments by Jessie Bates III, ensuring Atlanta's victory.

**Texans 19 - 13 Bears**  
In a game marked by defensive prowess, the Houston Texans edged out the Chicago Bears 19-13. C.J. Stroud’s 28-yard touchdown pass to Nico Collins and Ka'imi Fairbairn’s four field goals, including two from over 50 yards, highlighted Houston's scoring. The Texans' defense played a crucial role by intercepting rookie quarterback Caleb Williams twice and sacking him seven times. Despite a second-half offensive struggle and a fumble by Cam Akers, Houston's defense held strong, led by Will Anderson Jr.'s 1.5 sacks. The game was also notable for Fairbairn’s historic performance, as he became the first NFL player with five field goals of at least 50 yards over a two-game span.
