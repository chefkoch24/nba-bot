**Boston Celtics 106 - 88 Dallas Mavericks**  
Boston Celtics aim to secure their 18th NBA title in Game 5 of the Finals against the Dallas Mavericks, featuring former Celtic Kyrie Irving, who faces a hostile reception from Boston fans due to his past departure. The Mavericks are seeking to make history by overcoming a 3-0 deficit, buoyed by a dominant Game 4 performance where Luka Doncic scored 29 points and Irving added 21. Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla stressed the importance of basics like defense and execution for victory, while Jayson Tatum emphasized maintaining composure under pressure. Monday's game holds special significance as it marks 16 years since Boston's last championship in 2008.
