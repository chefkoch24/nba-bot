**New Jersey Devils 3 - 2 Minnesota Wild**  
The New Jersey Devils secured a 3-2 shootout victory against the Minnesota Wild, led by Luke Hughes, who tallied a goal and an assist. Hughes opened the scoring with a wrist shot in the first period, and despite the Wild's persistent rally, including a dramatic tying goal by Matt Boldy, the Devils managed to maintain their lead. Nico Hischier's redirection in the third period marked his fourth goal in two games, while goalie Jacob Markstrom delivered a stellar performance with 27 saves and didn't concede in the shootout. Filip Gustavsson was equally impressive for the Wild with 26 saves, notably stopping a crucial shot from Brett Pesce that prompted a tense video review. Although Paul Cotter's overtime goal was overturned due to offside, both he and Jesper Bratt secured the shootout goals for New Jersey. This win places the Devils seven points behind the Carolina Hurricanes in the Metropolitan Division, while the Wild, having lost three of their last four games, hold a slim lead for the first wild card spot in the Western Conference.

**Philadelphia Flyers 2 - 1 Nashville Predators**  
The Philadelphia Flyers secured their third consecutive victory under new coach Brad Shaw by defeating the Nashville Predators 2-1 at the Wells Fargo Center on Monday. Ryan Poehling and Jamie Drysdale netted goals for the Flyers, with Poehling capitalizing on a pass from Travis Konecny in the second period, while Drysdale quickly responded after a Nashville equalizer. Matvei Michkov and Konecny each provided two assists, continuing their impressive offensive chemistry; Michkov's current six-game point streak includes 11 points, underscoring his crucial role in the Flyers' offensive dynamic. The Predators suffered their eighth loss in the past ten games, despite notable performances from Zachary L'Heureux, who scored his first goal since December, and goaltender Justus Annunen. Nashville's struggles were evident when they conceded a goal merely 34 seconds after tying the game. The Flyers' win keeps them in contention for a playoff spot, though they remain six points behind the Montreal Canadiens. Notable milestones included Flyers forward Garnet Hathaway's return to the lineup for his 600th NHL game and Nashville's Jordan Oesterle playing his 400th NHL game.

**Colorado Avalanche 2 - 3 Calgary Flames**  
The Calgary Flames staged a dramatic third-period comeback to edge the Colorado Avalanche 3-2 in a shootout, thanks to quick goals by Ryan Lomberg and Adam Klapka just 32 seconds apart. The rally was supported by a strong performance from goaltender Dan Vladar, who made 28 saves, while Yegor Sharangovich netted the decisive goal in the shootout. The win helps Calgary, who had lost two straight, improve to 5-1-1 in their last seven games and move closer to a playoff spot. Despite Nathan MacKinnon's assist extending his home point streak to 25 games, the Avalanche stumbled with their second consecutive loss, now trailing the Dallas Stars by eight points for second place in the Central Division. Travis Weegar was outmaneuvered by Cale Makar, who opened scoring for Colorado, while Logan O'Connor extended their lead before Calgary's energizing surge. Makar's goal marked his 28th of the season, matching his career high, while MacKinnon made history as the first Avalanche/Quebec Nordiques player to achieve consecutive seasons with at least 80 assists.

**Seattle Kraken 1 - 3 Dallas Stars**  
Wyatt Johnston continued his scoring streak by netting a goal in his fifth consecutive game, helping the Dallas Stars secure a 3-1 victory over the Seattle Kraken at Climate Pledge Arena, marking their sixth straight win. The Stars, who previously defeated the Kraken 5-1, saw additional goals from Matt Duchene and Mikael Granlund, with Duchene tying the game early after Seattle's Kaapo Kakko initially put the Kraken ahead. Johnston's decisive goal shortly after Duchene's tied effort came from a skillful tip leading to a partial breakaway. Esa Lindell and Mason Marchment provided crucial assists, while Casey DeSmith made 36 saves for Dallas, which now trails the Winnipeg Jets by just four points for the Central Division lead. Despite Philipp Grubauer's 28 saves, the Kraken, with a recent 1-4-1 record, have been mathematically eliminated from playoff contention.
