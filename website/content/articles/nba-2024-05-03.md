**Indiana Pacers 120 - 98 Milwaukee Bucks**  
The Indiana Pacers celebrated their first playoff series victory in a decade by beating the Milwaukee Bucks 120-98 in Game 6. T.J. McConnell and Obi Toppin led the way, with McConnell scoring a playoff career-high and Toppin also having a playoff career high scoring total. The Bucks played without Giannis Antetokounmpo, and while Damian Lillard returned and scored 28 points, it wasn't enough. Indiana took control with a 23-3 first-quarter run and held off Milwaukee's comeback attempts. McConnell's 11-0 run in the fourth quarter put the game out of reach, setting off the celebration for the Pacers and sending them to their first Eastern Conference semifinal in a decade.
