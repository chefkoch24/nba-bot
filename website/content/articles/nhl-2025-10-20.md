**Utah Hockey Club 3 - 2 Boston Bruins**  
In a thrilling game on Saturday, the Utah Hockey Club secured a 2-1 overtime victory against the Boston Bruins at Delta Center, with Michael Kesselring scoring the decisive goal 2:46 into overtime. This marked Utah's first-ever overtime home win in franchise history. The game was tightly contested, with Vladislav Kolyachonok tying the score at 14:51 of the third period on a backhand shot, marking his first goal of the season in just his 45th NHL game. Connor Ingram was instrumental in goal, making 22 saves for Utah, while Jeremy Swayman saved 30 for Boston. Cole Koepke scored the Bruins' only goal, but their lead was short-lived as Utah's resilience shone through, even after a potential tying goal by Kailer Yamamoto was overturned for offside. Utah's victory continued their trend of strong overtime performances, having won three out of four games decided in extra time this season. The team benefited from contributions across the lineup, a testament to their depth and teamwork.
