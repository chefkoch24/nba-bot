**Cleveland Cavaliers 146 - 134 Minnesota Timberwolves**  
The Cleveland Cavaliers managed to halt the Minnesota Timberwolves' four-game winning streak with a high-scoring 146-134 victory on Saturday, driven by Donovan Mitchell's 28-point performance. In a game where the Cavaliers saw five players, including Mitchell, Evan Mobley, Jaylon Tyson, Darius Garland, and Sam Merrill, score at least 20 points for only the second time in franchise history, Merrill set a franchise record by making at least five 3-pointers in four consecutive games. The Cavs marked this achievement for the first time since 1972 and recorded their fourth-highest regulation game score ever. The Timberwolves, despite Anthony Edwards and Naz Reid each contributing 25 points, saw their season-best field goal percentage of 57.3% fall short against Cleveland's season-high shooting accuracy of 59.2%. After trailing at halftime, Cleveland took command with a pivotal 12-0 run in the third quarter. Both teams traded leads frequently in the first quarter, but the Cavaliers pulled ahead in the second half, securing their fifth win in seven games.

The Indiana Pacers dominated the Miami Heat in a 123-99 victory, bolstered by Andrew Nembhard's standout performance with 29 points and nine assists. The Pacers, achieving their second consecutive win to match their longest winning streak of the season, never trailed and maintained a strong lead throughout.

In contrast, the Heat struggled offensively, shooting just 39.1% from the field. Despite Tyler Herro's 21 points and Bam Adebayo's near double-double with 13 points and nine rebounds, the Heat missed their first 11 three-point attempts and have now lost three of their last four games.

**Detroit Pistons 92 - 98 LA Clippers**  
The Los Angeles Clippers staged an impressive comeback to defeat the depleted Detroit Pistons 98-92, overcoming a 19-point first-half deficit and a 14-point gap in the final quarter. A strong 28-8 run by the Clippers in the closing minutes, fueled by Kawhi Leonard's 26 points and John Collins' 25 points, secured their victory. James Harden contributed significantly with 19 points, seven rebounds, and seven assists. Detroit struggled without key players, including Cade Cunningham, Isaiah Stewart, Tobias Harris, and Jalen Duren, who were all sidelined due to various ailments. Despite Duncan Robinson scoring 20 points, the Pistons faltered under the pressure, committing 12 of their 25 total turnovers in the fourth quarter, which proved costly. Additionally, a crucial windmill dunk by Ron Holland II had given Detroit a promising lead early in the fourth, but the Clippers rallied back effectively, aided by critical plays like Harden's three-point play and crucial defense in the final minutes.
