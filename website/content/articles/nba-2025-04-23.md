**Los Angeles Lakers 94 - 85 Minnesota Timberwolves**  
The Minnesota Timberwolves seized an early lead in their playoff series against the Los Angeles Lakers with a dominant 117-95 win in Game 1, showcasing their physical style that the Lakers struggled to counter. Despite Luka Doncic's standout performance for the Lakers, scoring 37 points, the team faltered due to poor shooting and a lack of response to the Timberwolves' aggression.
