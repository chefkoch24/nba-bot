**New England Patriots 24 - 25 Indianapolis Colts**  
In a thrilling finish, Indianapolis Colts quarterback Anthony Richardson displayed his late-game heroics, throwing a 3-yard touchdown pass to Alec Pierce and running for a critical two-point conversion with just 12 seconds left, securing a 25-24 victory over the New England Patriots. This marks Richardson's second comeback win in three games, showcasing his growth and confidence in high-pressure situations. The Patriots, led by Drake Maye's strong passing game, were unable to capitalize on their red-zone opportunities, managing touchdowns in only two out of six visits. Their chance at a last-second victory was thwarted when Joey Slye's ambitious 68-yard field goal attempt fell short. Jonathan Taylor was a standout for the Colts, rushing for 96 yards to surpass Marshall Faulk on the franchise's all-time rushing list. New England's attempt to control the game with a season-high 200 rushing yards was marred by penalties and inefficiencies in the red zone. With this loss, the Patriots are now out of playoff contention, while the Colts keep their postseason ambitions alive.

**Cincinnati Bengals 38 - 44 Pittsburgh Steelers**  
In a thrilling AFC North showdown, Russell Wilson silenced any quarterback controversy by leading the Pittsburgh Steelers to a nail-biting 44-38 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals. Wilson threw for a season-high 414 yards and three touchdowns, marking his second-highest passing yard game in his career, while also leading the Steelers to a 9-3 record. Despite an early interception returned for a touchdown, Wilson's performance was pivotal in what Steelers coach Mike Tomlin called a historic addition to the series between these two rivals. The Steelers secured a 27-21 lead at halftime, in what was the highest-scoring first half in the history of their rivalry. Joe Burrow, despite his 309 passing yards and three TDs, struggled with turnovers, including a crucial fumble returned for a touchdown by Payton Wilson. The Bengals dropped to 4-8 with playoff hopes dimming, having allowed over 34 points in multiple recent games, while the Steelers prepare for a challenging stretch ahead against some of the NFL's toughest teams.

**Atlanta Falcons 13 - 17 Los Angeles Chargers**  
In an intense clash of defensive prowess, the Los Angeles Chargers edged out the Atlanta Falcons 17-13, driven by the standout performance of rookie cornerback Tarheeb Still. Still's two interceptions, including a pivotal 61-yard return for a touchdown, were instrumental in securing Atlanta's third consecutive loss. Despite the Chargers' offensive struggles, yielding five sacks and just 187 total yards, their defense compensated by seizing four interceptions from Falcons' quarterback Kirk Cousins, marking only the second four-interception game of his career. Cousins, who equaled his career-worst performance, lamented missed opportunities as his late-game interceptions thwarted potential game-winning drives. Chargers’ head coach Jim Harbaugh praised the overall defensive effort and strategic opportunism, despite a failed fake punt attempt that could have proved costly. With Cousins' controversial performance raising discussions of a potential QB change, Falcons coach Raheem Morris remained steadfast in his support, underscoring the team's current first-place divisional standing. The Chargers now prepare to face the formidable Kansas City Chiefs, while the Falcons look to recover against the Minnesota Vikings.

**Baltimore Ravens 19 - 24 Philadelphia Eagles**  
In a competitive clash between the Philadelphia Eagles and Baltimore Ravens, the Eagles secured a 24-19 victory, marking their eighth consecutive win. Despite a much-discussed showdown between running backs Saquon Barkley and Derrick Henry, it was Philadelphia's defense that stole the spotlight, successfully containing Lamar Jackson and limiting Henry to 82 rushing yards. Barkley's late-game efforts, highlighted by a 25-yard touchdown, led to his 107-yard rushing performance, potentially bolstering his MVP candidacy. Besides, the game was notable for the struggles of Baltimore kicker Justin Tucker, who missed two field goals and an extra point, contributing to the Ravens' defeat. Jalen Hurts helped rally the Eagles from an early 9-0 deficit by throwing a touchdown pass and scoring on a sneak. The Ravens' early advantage, aided by six Eagles penalties, was undone as Philadelphia dominated the second quarter, underscored by punter Braden Mann's strategic punts that set up favorable field positions. Both teams dealt with significant player injuries, but the Eagles eventually overcame their challenges to remain atop the NFC East.

Williams also tallied two sacks and a blocked kick, becoming the first player since 1982 to achieve this rare combination in a single game. Zach Charbonnet secured the win with a late 8-yard touchdown run, aided by multiple Jets penalties on the drive. Despite a promising start and a 99-yard kickoff return touchdown by Kene Nwangwu, the Jets struggled offensively in the second half, unable to recover from Rodgers' costly interception. The Jets, who have now lost three consecutive games, face increasing pressure under interim coach Jeff Ulbrich. Seattle's victory marked their third straight win, propelling them to the top of the NFC West standings.

Joe Mixon delivered a standout performance with 101 rushing yards and a touchdown, joining an elite group as the third player in NFL history to record at least 100 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown in six road games during the same season. The victory, the Texans' 12th in their last 14 meetings with the Jaguars, came after a violent late hit by Azeez Al-Shaair knocked Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence out with a concussion, sparking a sideline brawl. Replacing Lawrence, Mac Jones led a spirited comeback attempt that fell short. The game also saw key injuries for both teams and concluded as Jaguars' running backs coach Jerry Mack announced his departure to become head coach at Kennesaw State.

Sam Darnold, who passed for 235 yards, showed his prowess in critical moments, posting 104 yards in the fourth quarter alone. Despite Kyler Murray's earlier success, his two fourth-quarter interceptions hindered the Cardinals' chance to secure a win, leaving them one game behind Seattle in the NFC West standings. Meanwhile, the Vikings defense, despite losing standout Stephon Gilmore to injury, managed to hold firm, culminating in a game-ending interception by Shaquill Griffin. Despite early mistakes, including two fumbles by Aaron Jones, the Vikings prevailed, maintaining their position behind Detroit in the NFC North and setting their sights on upcoming challenges against the Atlanta Falcons.

Tennessee struggled significantly with penalties outweighing offensive yards in the first half and only put points on the board late in each half. This defeat dampens any remaining hopes of a playoff push despite their previous week's upset over Houston. Notable defensive efforts from Frankie Luvu and Bobby Wagner further underscored Washington's all-around dominance in the game.
