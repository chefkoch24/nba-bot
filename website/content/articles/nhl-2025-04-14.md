**Ottawa Senators 4 - 3 Philadelphia Flyers**  
The Ottawa Senators secured a 4-3 overtime victory against the Philadelphia Flyers, with Tim Stutzle leading the charge by scoring twice, including the game-winner during a 4-on-3 power play. Stutzle, who recently broke a scoring drought, also contributed an assist, and his performance earned praise from Coach Travis Green for his offensive maturity at just 23 years old. Thomas Chabot tied the game in the third period and notched two assists, furthering his five-game point streak. The Senators displayed resilience, rallying after a 3-2 Flyers lead created by Garnet Hathaway's goal. With this win, Ottawa clinched a wild card spot in the Eastern Conference playoffs, setting the stage for a series against either Toronto or Tampa Bay. Nick Cousins returned from a lengthy injury, adding emotional depth to the victory. For the Flyers, Hathaway contributed both a goal and an assist in a game where his team showed commendable spirit despite a challenging season.

**New Jersey Devils 0 - 1 New York Islanders**  
Sorokin makes 25 saves in return, Islanders shut out Devils
 **NEWARK, N.J. --** <forge-entity title="Ilya Sorokin" slug="ilya-sorokin-8478009" code="player">Ilya Sorokin</forge-entity> made 25 saves to earn his fourth shutout of the season for the New York Islanders in a 1-0 win against the New Jersey Devils at Prudential Center on Sunday. 
"We played really well in front of \[Sorokin\]," New York coach Patrick Roy said. "That's what I was hoping to see. He deserved a performance like that from us."

Sorokin, making his first start in three games after sustaining a lower-body injury in a 7-6 overtime loss at the Nashville Predators on Tuesday, earned his 22nd career shutout to tie Billy Smith for the second most in franchise history behind Glenn Resch (25). It was also his first against the Devils. 
<forge-entity title="Bo Horvat" slug="bo-horvat-8477500" code="player">Bo Horvat</forge-entity> scored the lone goal in the final minute of the second period for New York (35-33-12), which had lost nine of 11 (2-5-4), including a 4-3 shootout loss at the Philadelphia Flyers on Saturday, and will miss the Stanley Cup Playoffs for the first time in three seasons.

"You've just got to do your job," Islanders captain <forge-entity title="Anders Lee" slug="anders-lee-8475314" code="player">Anders Lee</forge-entity> said. "We're obviously disappointed with where we are at. You still have to love the game and enjoy it and give everything you have to the boys next to you."

<forge-entity title="Jacob Markstrom" slug="jacob-markstrom-8474593" code="player">Jacob Markstrom</forge-entity> made 21 saves for the Devils (41-32-7), who lost their third straight and are 4-4-0 in their past eight games. New Jersey is third in the Metropolitan Division and will play the Carolina Hurricanes in the Eastern Conference First Round.

"I really liked our start and our finish; I'd say probably 40 of the 60 minutes weren't good enough in terms of offense," Devils coach Sheldon Keefe said. "I mean, defensively, we were good, didn't give up much and Markstrom was really good. I thought we probably should have had one if we can execute a little bit better, hit the net a little more. But all in all, it was a pretty sleepy game."

New Jersey has been held without a goal for five straight periods after scoring twice in the first period of a 4-2 loss to the Pittsburgh Penguins on Friday.

"I mean, we're trying," Devils defenseman <forge-entity title="Luke Hughes" slug="luke-hughes-8482684" code="player">Luke Hughes</forge-entity> said. "I mean, it's harder than it looks, but the guys are trying. Tonight, we were probably on the perimeter too much but we're trying to get pucks through and trying to create plays and create time and space. Some nights it just doesn't go your way, and every game has its own spirit, I guess you could say, and tonight didn't go our way.

“I think we're a really good team and guys in this locker room know that. We’re gearing up for playoffs, but we just got to keep going and be ready to play these games.”

New Jersey has two games remaining in the regular season.

Horvat appeared to score 11:01 into the first period, but the play was immediately waved off before video review confirmed that he batted the puck into the net with his right glove.

Horvat gave the Islanders a 1-0 lead at 19:03 of the second period when he stole a pass by <forge-entity title="Timo Meier" slug="timo-meier-8478414" code="player">Timo Meier</forge-entity> in the high slot and scored on a wrist shot from the left hash mark.

"It stinks playing an entire season and coming up short," Horvat said. "It's on us in the room that we didn't get the job done. These last couple of games here, they mean a lot." 
Islanders defenseman <forge-entity title="Adam Pelech" slug="adam-pelech-8476917" code="player">Adam Pelech</forge-entity> took an elbow to the face from forward <forge-entity title="Paul Cotter" slug="paul-cotter-8481032" code="player">Paul Cotter</forge-entity> at center ice at 6:00 of the second period and didn't return. Roy had no update after the game.

Cotter received a 5-minute match penalty for an illegal hit to the head.

"That's the kind of hit we don't like ... we don't want to see happening," Roy said.

**NOTES:** Horvat, who had a game-high six shots on goal in 19:18 of ice time, has five points (three goals, two assists) in his past five games. ... The Islanders are 6-3-2 in their last 11 games against the Devils. ... New Jersey defenseman Dougie Hamilton missed his 17th straight game but did participate in pregame warmups after practicing with the team on Saturday for the first time since sustaining a lower-body injury on March 4. Keefe said there's a good chance he could be ready for the start of the playoffs.

**Pittsburgh Penguins 1 - 4 Boston Bruins**  
The Boston Bruins ended the Pittsburgh Penguins' 10-game point streak with a 6-4 victory at PPG Paints Arena, with six different Bruins contributing goals in the win. Pavel Zacha led the scoring with a goal and an assist, supporting their solid performance that kept Boston at the top of the Atlantic Division. The Penguins, who were 7-0-3 in their previous ten games, fell out of playoff contention, trailing the Washington Capitals, Detroit Red Wings, and Philadelphia Flyers by a point with two games remaining. Erik Karlsson recorded an assist in his milestone 1,000th NHL game, and Sidney Crosby reached 90 points at age 36, becoming the ninth player in NHL history to achieve that feat at such an age. Meanwhile, Pat Maroon made his debut for the Bruins following a trade from the Minnesota Wild but saw limited action after returning from back surgery.

The Tampa Bay Lightning secured a 7-4 victory over the Buffalo Sabres, bolstered by Nikita Kucherov's standout performance with two goals and an assist, helping them move two points ahead of the Florida Panthers in the Atlantic Division standings.

Tampa Bay pulled away with a decisive second period, scoring four goals, in a game marked by Jake Guentzel's two goals and Brandon Hagel's three assists. Despite a late push from the Sabres, with goals from Jiri Kulich, Alex Tuch, Connor Clifton, and Sam Lafferty, Buffalo suffered their third straight loss. Conor Geekie, recently called up, contributed a goal, while Emil Lilleberg scored his first NHL goal, adding to the Lightning's dominant offensive display and showcasing the emerging talent within the team.
