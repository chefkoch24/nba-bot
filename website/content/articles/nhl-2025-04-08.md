**New York Rangers 1 - 5 Tampa Bay Lightning**  
The Tampa Bay Lightning decisively defeated the New York Rangers 5-1 at Madison Square Garden, moving within two points of the Atlantic Division lead behind the Toronto Maple Leafs. Brayden Point was pivotal with two goals, hitting the 40-goal mark for the third consecutive season, tying a record with Steven Stamkos for the Lightning. Meanwhile, Nikita Kucherov notched a goal and two assists, elevating his point tally to 115 for the season, tying him for the NHL scoring lead, and becoming the fourth player in NHL history to achieve at least 80 assists in three consecutive seasons. The Lightning showed their power-play prowess with goals from Point, including a pivotal three-goal burst within under two minutes during the first period. Jake Guentzel's three assists and Andrei Vasilevskiy's 38 saves solidified the Lightning's control, despite the Rangers' strong objection marked by Mika Zibanejad's lone goal. The loss delivered a blow to the Rangers' playoff aspirations, as they trail the Montreal Canadiens by six points for the Eastern Conference's second wild card.

The Winnipeg Jets ended the St. Louis Blues' franchise-record 12-game winning streak with a 3-1 victory, strengthening their lead for the Presidents' Trophy and the Central Division title. This win marked the Jets' franchise record for seasonal victories at 53, as they surpassed their previous high of 52 wins. Alex Iafallo, Morgan Barron, and Adam Lowry scored for the Jets, with Connor Hellebuyck making 14 saves. Barron opened the scoring in the second period, and Iafallo broke a 1-1 tie with a third-period goal. Lowry secured the win with an empty-net goal.

Hellebuyck continues to impress, tying his career high for wins in a season and matching Craig Anderson for the fifth-most career wins by a U.S.-born goalie.
