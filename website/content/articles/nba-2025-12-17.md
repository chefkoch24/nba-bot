The New York Knicks clinched the NBA Cup with a 124-113 victory over the San Antonio Spurs in Las Vegas, marking a significant achievement since their last NBA championship in 1973. OG Anunoby led the Knicks with 28 points while Jalen Brunson, who was named the NBA Cup MVP, added 25 points. The win was distinguished by the Knicks' dominance in the paint, as they outrebounded the Spurs 59-42, aided by Mitchell Robinson's 15 boards. Despite facing an in-game injury, Karl-Anthony Towns contributed 16 points and 11 rebounds. Although the Spurs, led by Dylan Harper with 21 points and Victor Wembanyama with 18, held the lead for much of the game, the Knicks' crucial 13-1 run late in the third quarter secured their victory. Notably, each Knicks player on a standard contract earned an additional $318,560 for the win, bringing their total earnings to $530,933 for reaching the final. Despite the game not affecting standings, both teams now hold an 18-7 record, leading their divisions. Historically, finalists, including the Lakers and Thunder, have succeeded in subsequent playoff campaigns, indicating a promising future for both squads.
