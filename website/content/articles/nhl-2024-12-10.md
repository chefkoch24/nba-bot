**Buffalo Sabres 5 - 6 Detroit Red Wings**  
The Detroit Red Wings snapped a five-game losing streak by defeating the Buffalo Sabres 6-5 in a shootout at KeyBank Center. Andrew Copp was instrumental for Detroit, scoring two goals, including one that initiated a third-period comeback after the Sabres had led 5-3. Moritz Seider equalized the game 5-5 with a goal in the third period, contributing to the Red Wings' resilience. Ville Husso, Detroit's starting goalie, was replaced by Sebastian Cossa after three goals on seven shots in the first period; Cossa, making his NHL debut, played a crucial role with 12 saves. Jason Zucker's two goals for the Sabres were not enough to prevent their seventh consecutive loss. Notably, Lucas Raymond continued his impressive form with a goal and an assist, maintaining a hot streak of nine goals in ten games.

**New York Rangers 1 - 2 Chicago Blackhawks**  
The Chicago Blackhawks ended their five-game losing streak with a narrow 2-1 victory over the New York Rangers at Madison Square Garden, marking their first win under interim coach Anders Sorensen. The Blackhawks were propelled by Taylor Hall, who contributed a game-winning goal and an assist, and strong goaltending from Arvid Soderblom, who made 29 saves. This victory was significant for Soderblom, starting in place of the injured Petr Mrazek, as it marked his second win of the season and first since early November. The Rangers, struggling with a recent 2-8-0 record, were unable to capitalize on several opportunities despite a strong start, with Will Cuylle scoring their lone goal. The loss was compounded by frustrations over execution and fatigue, as expressed by Rangers coach Peter Laviolette and players like Artemi Panarin. In addition to securing the win, the Blackhawks continued their streak of shutting down opponents' power plays, having not allowed a power-play goal in their past six games. The Rangers' Igor Shesterkin, fresh off signing a lucrative contract, returned to action following the birth of his daughter.

**Montreal Canadiens 3 - 2 Anaheim Ducks**  
The Montreal Canadiens edged out the Anaheim Ducks in an exciting 3-2 shootout victory at Bell Centre, with Patrik Laine playing a crucial role by scoring both in regulation and the shootout. Laine, who returned from a preseason knee injury, now has three power-play goals in four games. Canadiens' goaltender Sam Montembeault was a key factor, registering 27 saves and stopping both Anaheim shootout attempts to secure the win. Troy Terry shone for the Ducks, scoring twice and nearly sealing the game in overtime, but his last-second attempt hit the crossbar. Montreal's Kirby Dach broke a personal scoring drought with a timely second-period goal, aided by Juraj Slafkovsky, who contributed an assist after going four games without a point. Debuting for Anaheim, Jacob Trouba made an impact with a physical presence and quick offensive support. Lane Hutson set a franchise record with his assist and point streak for a Canadiens rookie defenseman.
