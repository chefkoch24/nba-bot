**Brooklyn Nets 113 - 115 Boston Celtics**  
Kristaps Porzingis made a triumphant return for the Boston Celtics, scoring 24 points, including 14 in the fourth quarter, to help secure a narrow 115-113 victory over the Brooklyn Nets. Despite missing eight games due to illness, Porzingis delivered crucial plays late in the game to fend off a Nets comeback attempt that trimmed a 21-point Celtics lead down to two. Payton Pritchard added 22 points, setting an NBA single-season record with his 219th 3-pointer off the bench, while Jayson Tatum contributed 20 points, eight rebounds, and eight assists. The Celtics, who were without Derrick White, Al Horford, and Jaylen Brown (due to back spasms), managed the win after already clinching a playoff spot the previous night. Meanwhile, the struggling Nets, who have lost 10 of their last 11 games, were led by Cam Johnson's 23 points but suffered a blow with the announcement that leading scorer Cam Thomas is out for the season due to a hamstring injury. Boston continued their winning streak in Brooklyn, not having lost there since April 2021, and will face the Nets again at home on Tuesday.
