In a closely contested match, the Atlanta Hawks edged out the Charlotte Hornets 107-104, marking their third consecutive win while extending the Hornets' losing streak to five games. Jalen Johnson led the Hawks with 20 points and nine assists, supported by De'Andre Hunter's 18 points. Onyeka Okongwu contributed a double-double with 16 points and 11 rebounds. Despite Brandon Miller's impressive 32-point performance for the Hornets, his missed off-balance 3-pointer in the final seconds allowed the Hawks to secure the victory. Trae Young and Zaccharie Risacher each scored 14 points for Atlanta, though Young struggled early with turnovers. Charlotte, missing key players like LaMelo Ball, saw Nick Richards return to action after a multi-game absence, providing much-needed support with 12 points and five rebounds before being fouled out. Moussa Diabate was a bright spot for the Hornets with eight offensive rebounds, but it wasn't enough to clinch a win. The Hawks will host the Pelicans next, while the Hornets wrap up their homestand against the 76ers.
