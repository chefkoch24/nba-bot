**Pittsburgh Penguins 1 - 0 Ottawa Senators**  
Crosby, Penguins edge Senators in OT
 **PITTSBURGH** \-\- <forge-entity title="Sidney Crosby" slug="sidney-crosby-8471675" code="player">Sidney Crosby</forge-entity> scored 1:16 into overtime, and <forge-entity title="Tristan Jarry" slug="tristan-jarry-8477465" code="player">Tristan Jarry</forge-entity> made 31 saves for the Pittsburgh Penguins in a 1-0 win against the Ottawa Senators at PPG Paints Arena on Sunday. 
Crosby won it with a one-timer from the right face-off circle set up by <forge-entity title="Erik Karlsson" slug="erik-karlsson-8474578" code="player">Erik Karlsson</forge-entity> on the power play, extending his point streak to 10 games (15 points; eight goals, seven assists).

“I thought we had some good \[chances\],” Crosby said. “You always want to try to get more bodies and pucks to the net. There’s always games where you look back after the fact and you think about, maybe, opportunities you could have just put there. Maybe there were a couple of those. But I thought for the most part, we did a pretty good job of generating chances.” 
The shutout was Jarry’s first this season and 20th in the NHL. He was pulled in each of the previous two games, allowing a combined eight goals on 19 shots.

The Penguins (30-34-11) had lost three in a row (0-2-1). They are six points behind the Montreal Canadiens, who have two games in hand, and the New York Rangers, who have one game in hand, for the second wild card into the Stanley Cup Playoffs from the Eastern Conference.

“I thought our team did a better job at limiting some of the high, high-quality looks that \[Jarry\] has been faced with the prior couple of games,” Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan said. “I thought our group, as a whole, did a better job working to limit not only the quality, but also the quantity of the looks. So, I’m sure that helped him, but he still made a few big saves.”

<forge-entity title="Anton Forsberg" slug="anton-forsberg-8476341" code="player">Anton Forsberg</forge-entity> made 34 saves for the Senators (39-28-6), who have a seven-point lead for the first wild card. They won 3-2 against the Columbus Blue Jackets on Saturday.

“I think it was obvious we didn’t have a lot of juice,” Ottawa coach Travis Green said. “You could see our game wasn’t as sharp as it was last night. We found a way to get a big point.”

Jarry made 16 saves in the first period.

“I honestly think it helps, being able to get quite a few shots like that just to start the game,” Jarry said. “I think it kind of gets you into the game quick and it kind of gets you feeling the puck. It’s the same for both ways. I think when we’re putting pucks on the net early and, I think, crashing the net and getting the puck back, kind of low to high, I think that kind of gets our team into it. I think it’s the same for a goalie, being able to get some shots early.” 
<forge-entity title="Nick Jensen" slug="nick-jensen-8475324" code="player">Nick Jensen</forge-entity> had a chance to put Ottawa ahead at 16:48 when he was left alone in the right circle for a wrist shot. Jarry pushed to his left for a pad save.

<forge-entity title="Claude Giroux" slug="claude-giroux-8473512" code="player">Claude Giroux</forge-entity> attempted to give the Senators the lead on a one-timer from the slot at 6:05 of the second period, but it hit Jarry’s right shoulder.

“Not to use it as an excuse, but coming in late last night, 5 o’clock tonight, it’s a tough back-to-back,” Ottawa defenseman <forge-entity title="Thomas Chabot" slug="thomas-chabot-8478469" code="player">Thomas Chabot</forge-entity> said. “I mean, they played a good game. You’ve got to give them some credit. They didn’t give us a whole lot.”

<forge-entity title="Rickard Rakell" slug="rickard-rakell-8476483" code="player">Rickard Rakell</forge-entity> came close for Pittsburgh at 8:33, dropping to one knee for a one-timer that hit the left post.

<forge-entity title="Shane Pinto" slug="shane-pinto-8481596" code="player">Shane Pinto</forge-entity> had a breakaway for the Senators at 17:35 of the third period, but his shot went off the right post.

“It could’ve gone either way,” Forsberg said. “You could tell we were a little tired tonight, but we battled it out and we got a point, a point that’s going to be super important in the end. Obviously, we would’ve loved the two points, but right now, we should be happy about getting one point and moving forward. All points are going to matter in the end.”

**NOTES**: Crosby scored his 97th game-winning goal, passing <forge-entity title="Mats Sundin" slug="mats-sundin-8451774" code="player">Mats Sundin</forge-entity> for the 12th-most in NHL history. It was his 24th career overtime goal, three behind Washington Capitals forward <forge-entity title="Alex Ovechkin" slug="alex-ovechkin-8471214" code="player">Alex Ovechkin</forge-entity> for the most in League history. ... Penguins forward <forge-entity title="Ville Koivunen" slug="ville-koivunen-8482758" code="player">Ville Koivunen</forge-entity> had two shots on goal in 17:28 of ice time in his NHL debut.

The Senators were outshot 16-4 in the third period and overtime after having a 27-19 advantage in the first two periods.

**Carolina Hurricanes 6 - 4 New York Islanders**  
In a thrilling 6-4 victory over the New York Islanders, the Carolina Hurricanes maintained their strong form with standout performances from Seth Jarvis and Sebastian Aho. Jarvis scored twice, including a crucial short-handed goal, matching a franchise record for such goals in a season, and contributed to the team's success by capitalizing on key opportunities. Aho played a pivotal role, registering a goal and two assists, marking his fourth career 40-assist season. Despite a spirited effort from Pierre Engvall, who netted two goals for the Islanders, they fell short and extended their losing streak to five games. With this win, the Hurricanes remain firmly in second place in the Metropolitan Division, extending their lead over the New Jersey Devils. This matchup was characterized by individual brilliance and strategic play, as highlighted by Aho’s crucial assists and Dmitry Orlov’s decisive slap shot. The Islanders are now in a tight race for a wild card spot in the Stanley Cup Playoffs, trailing the Canadiens and Rangers.

**Anaheim Ducks 2 - 3 Toronto Maple Leafs**  
The Toronto Maple Leafs narrowly defeated the Anaheim Ducks 3-2 at the Honda Center, further solidifying their lead in the Atlantic Division. Key performances from Max Domi, Mitch Marner, and Steven Lorentz, who scored the decisive goal on a deflection in the third period, highlighted Toronto's victory. Joseph Woll's 29 saves were crucial, as the Maple Leafs, feeling the fatigue of back-to-back games, managed to hold their structure and patience for the win. Despite Anaheim's efforts, with goals from Leo Carlsson and Sam Colangelo, who has been impactful since his recall from the AHL, the Ducks fell short. Mitch Marner's defensive play leading to a breakaway goal and the team's overall defensive blocks were pivotal in the win. Notably, John Tavares' five-game goal streak was snapped, and the game had a contentious moment when a potential goal was disallowed due to a missed high stick call. The Ducks faced setbacks with Troy Terry's late-game injury and Jacob Trouba's absence, leaving coach Greg Cronin focused on refining details like face-offs for future success.
