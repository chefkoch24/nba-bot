**Nashville Predators 1 - 3 Vegas Golden Knights**  
The Vegas Golden Knights secured their sixth straight victory with a 3-1 win over the Nashville Predators, as Reilly Smith, a recent acquisition from the New York Rangers, netted his first goal for the team to break a tie in the third period.

Goaltender Adin Hill, unexpectedly starting due to Ilya Samsonov's injury in warmup, made 23 saves, while Jack Eichel extended his point streak to six games with a goal and an assist. Nashville's Ryan O'Reilly initially put the Predators ahead before Eichel's equalizer, but Vegas successfully challenged for goaltender interference that negated a potential second goal for O'Reilly. Predators' forward Colton Sissons exited early due to injury, adding to the struggles of a team already out of playoff contention.

**Los Angeles Kings 1 - 3 Toronto Maple Leafs**  
John Tavares scored twice in the third period, including the winning goal with just under eight minutes left, leading the Toronto Maple Leafs to a 3-1 victory over the Los Angeles Kings at Crypto.com Arena. Tavares extended his goal streak to five games, totaling eight goals. Auston Matthews contributed a short-handed goal and an assist for Toronto, which climbed to the top of the Atlantic Division standings, moving ahead of the Florida Panthers and Tampa Bay Lightning. The Maple Leafs excelled in special teams, scoring on both the power play and a penalty kill, which Toronto coach Craig Berube noted was key to their win. In contrast, the Kings' impressive 15-game home point streak ended, and they lost at home in regulation for the first time since January 20th. Despite Alex Laferriere putting the Kings ahead early in the second period, Matthews' short-handed goal early in the third, and Tavares' crucial power-play goal shifted the game in Toronto's favor.
