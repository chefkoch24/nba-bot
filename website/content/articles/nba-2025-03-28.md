**Cleveland Cavaliers 124 - 116 San Antonio Spurs**  
The Cleveland Cavaliers secured a 124-116 victory over the San Antonio Spurs, thanks to standout performances from Jarrett Allen and Donovan Mitchell. Allen posted a season-high 29 points and snagged 16 rebounds, while Mitchell contributed a career-high 14 assists, nearing his first career triple-double with 25 points and eight rebounds. A pivotal moment came when Allen's three-point play, assisted by Mitchell, pushed the Cavs ahead 117-112, followed by Darius Garland's crucial three-pointer. Rookie Stephon Castle and Devin Vassell both scored 22 points for the Spurs, who continue to vie for a Western Conference play-in spot. Despite recent shooting struggles, Mitchell, likened by his coach to a baseball player in a slump, delivered the game's key play. Star Spur Victor Wembanyama remains out for the season following surgery for deep vein thrombosis in his shoulder, leaving the team's future plans for him undisclosed. The Cavaliers rested star forward Evan Mobley and missed the presence of sixth man Ty Jerome due to a knee issue. The Spurs are set to face Boston, while Cleveland will continue their schedule against Detroit.
