**Pittsburgh Penguins 1 - 4 Carolina Hurricanes**  
The Carolina Hurricanes secured a commanding 4-1 victory over the Pittsburgh Penguins by scoring four consecutive goals, including two on the power play at PPG Paints Arena. Martin Necas, who contributed a goal and an assist, and Shayne Gostisbehere, whose power-play prowess was instrumental, highlighted the game for the Hurricanes. Carolina's Frederik Andersen was solid in net, making 25 saves, while the Penguins struggled, being outshot 28-11 in the first two periods and failing to capitalize on five power play chances. Despite Drew O’Connor giving Pittsburgh an early lead with his third goal of the season, the Hurricanes responded effectively, thanks to a disciplined approach emphasized by coach Rod Brind’Amour. Notably, Penguins stars Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin were held without a shot on goal, a stark contrast to their previous high-scoring performances.

**Colorado Avalanche 4 - 3 Anaheim Ducks**  
The Colorado Avalanche secured their first win of the season by overcoming the Anaheim Ducks 4-3 in overtime at Ball Arena, thanks to Nathan MacKinnon's decisive goal with just 41 seconds left in the extra period. Despite being heavily outshot 49-20, the Ducks managed to keep the game close, largely due to a remarkable 45-save performance by goalie Lukas Dostal. Anaheim's Troy Terry had tied the game with a last-minute goal in the third period, turning the final moments into a suspenseful showdown. Nathan MacKinnon, who also registered an assist, noted his goal wasn't his best shot, but it was enough to secure a much-needed ugly win for the team. Ross Colton contributed two goals, helping the Avalanche to claw back from a 2-0 deficit, with key players like Mikko Rantanen and Casey Mittelstadt also making significant impacts. This win avoided what would have been Colorado's fifth straight loss of the season.
