**New Orleans Pelicans 108 - 115 Phoenix Suns**  
In a thrilling matchup, Devin Booker powered the Phoenix Suns to a 115-108 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans, scoring 30 points with 12 in the decisive fourth quarter.

Mark Williams played a key role, adding 24 points, including 10 in the final quarter, and 13 rebounds. Zion Williamson led the Pelicans with 20 points, but New Orleans struggled at the free-throw line, converting only 25 of 42 attempts. A critical moment came when Collin Gillespie hit a jumper to initiate a five-point run, sealing the game for Phoenix. The Suns overcame poor three-point shooting by dominating the boards, especially in the first half, leading to a significant second-chance points advantage. Despite their troubles, the Pelicans stayed competitive thanks in part to Jordan Poole's impressive shooting and free-throw opportunities. However, New Orleans will need to improve its foul shooting when the teams meet again.

**Utah Jazz 131 - 129 Detroit Pistons**  
In a thrilling encounter, the Detroit Pistons pulled off an upset victory over the Utah Jazz in Salt Lake City, bolstered by their depth and collective effort. Despite being overlooked for the Christmas Day showcase, the Pistons entered the game leading the Eastern Conference with an impressive 24-6 record, their best start since the 2005-06 season. Detroit's recent triumphs over Portland and Sacramento underscored their robust lineup, with coach JB Bickerstaff praising contributions from players like Tobias Harris and Jalen Duren. The Jazz, meanwhile, continued to struggle defensively, entering the game on a four-game losing streak and allowing an average of 127.4 points per game, the league's worst. The matchup also spotlighted a showdown between top scorers Cade Cunningham of Detroit and Utah's Lauri Markkanen, with Cunningham previously besting Markkanen in their November encounter. Despite a high-scoring and competitive history between the two players, the Jazz's defensive inefficiencies proved too significant to overcome this time, highlighting their ongoing challenges in communication and consistency.
