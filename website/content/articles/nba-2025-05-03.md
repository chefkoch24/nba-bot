**Golden State Warriors 107 - 115 Houston Rockets**  
The Houston Rockets forced a Game 7 in their first-round playoff series against the Golden State Warriors with a 115-107 victory in San Francisco. Fred VanVleet led the Rockets with 29 points, eight assists, and eight rebounds, while Alperen Sengun contributed 21 points and 14 rebounds. The Warriors suffered a cold spell, missing 13 consecutive shots in the fourth quarter, a crucial stretch that saw a missed opportunity to secure a series win at home. Stephen Curry scored 29 points with a 6-for-16 performance from beyond the arc, and Jimmy Butler added 27 points, nine rebounds, and eight assists. Houston's balanced attack was highlighted by a four-point play from VanVleet early in the fourth quarter and a significant 3-pointer later in the period that helped solidify their lead. Despite the Warriors' previous 3-1 series advantage, Golden State now faces the prospect of traveling to Houston for a decisive matchup after struggling in Game 5 with Houston's revitalized offense. Draymond Green's achievement of surpassing Isiah Thomas on the NBA playoff assists list and a flagrant foul call in the first quarter added notable elements to an intense game.
