**Oklahoma City Thunder 134 - 128 LA Clippers**  
Shai Gilgeous-Alexander delivered a career-best performance with 45 points as the Oklahoma City Thunder triumphed over the Los Angeles Clippers 134-128, despite the absence of Chet Holmgren, sidelined for at least eight weeks due to a pelvic fracture. Gilgeous-Alexander excelled with 13 of 21 from the field and nearly perfect free-throw shooting, adding nine assists to his stats. Oklahoma City's relentless pace contributed to their success, even though they were outrebounded 47-29 and lacked height with their tallest starter at 6-foot-6. Jalen Williams and Lu Dort added 28 and 19 points respectively to compensate for Holmgren's absence. Norman Powell led the Clippers with 31 points but fouled out late, while Ivica Zubac and Derrick Jones Jr. also contributed significantly. Despite James Harden's near triple-double, the Clippers were hampered by turnovers and foul trouble, committing 24 turnovers leading to 32 Thunder points.
