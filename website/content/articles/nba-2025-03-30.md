**Orlando Magic 121 - 91 Sacramento Kings**

**Washington Wizards 112 - 115 Brooklyn Nets**  
In an intense matchup, the Brooklyn Nets managed to end a six-game losing streak by narrowly defeating the Washington Wizards, 115-112. Drew Timme played a crucial role, scoring the go-ahead basket with 7.7 seconds left in just his second NBA game, following his signing with the Nets. Despite a strong performance by Washington's Colby Jones and AJ Johnson, each contributing 20 points, a late turnover from Jones sealed their fate. Jalen Wilson and Tyrese Martin supported Brooklyn's effort, each also scoring 20 points to help the Nets avoid a complete season sweep by the Wizards. The Wizards, who were coming off a historically bad loss to Indiana, struggled with their shooting beyond the arc, missing 12 of their 13 attempts in the first half, yet led at halftime due to effective free throw shooting. Timme impressed with his performance, having previously achieved a double-double in his debut game, making him only the fifth player in Nets history to do so. Both teams are set to play again on Monday, with the Nets facing Dallas and the Wizards taking on Miami.

**Philadelphia 76ers 95 - 118 Miami Heat**  
In a decisive victory, Tyler Herro scored 30 points to lead the Miami Heat to a 118-95 win over the shorthanded Philadelphia 76ers, marking Miami's fourth consecutive win after a 10-game losing streak. Despite being without key players like Andrew Wiggins and Duncan Robinson, the Heat were successful, with Herro hitting five of the team's 20 three-pointers and Alec Burks adding 20 points. In contrast, the 76ers, led by Jared Butler's 19 points, suffered their seventh straight defeat, which officially eliminated them from playoff contention. The team has been plagued by injuries, with notable absences including Joel Embiid and Paul George, while key players like Tyrese Maxey sat out the game as they aim for a better draft pick. The 76ers have lost 24 of their last 28 games, as Coach Nick Nurse focuses on evaluating future prospects like Quentin Grimes, who scored 15 points. Miami capitalized on Philadelphiaâ€™s weakened state, outscoring them 34-22 in the third quarter and securing their spot in the Eastern Conference play-in tournament. The Heat continue their road trip at Washington on Monday, while the 76ers host Toronto on Sunday.

**Memphis Grizzlies 127 - 134 Los Angeles Lakers**  
In a thrilling game in Memphis, the Los Angeles Lakers triumphed over the Grizzlies with a 134-127 victory in the first game for Memphis under interim coach Tuomas Iisalo following the firing of Taylor Jenkins. Austin Reaves was a standout performer, scoring 31 points and providing eight assists, while Luka Doncic contributed 29 points and nine assists. LeBron James, sporting a headband, added 25 points to the Lakers' efforts.

**Oklahoma City Thunder 132 - 111 Indiana Pacers**  
Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Oklahoma City Thunder with 33 points as they extended their winning streak to nine games by defeating the Indiana Pacers 132-111. Despite resting Chet Holmgren due to an ongoing left hip injury, the Thunder maintained their dominance, thanks in part to Lu Dort's 22 points and impressive shooting from beyond the arc. The Pacers, who had been performing well with six wins in their previous seven games, couldn't match Oklahoma City's pace, shooting efficiency, or league-best defense. The Thunder now hold a three-game lead over the Cleveland Cavaliers for the league's best record and crucial homecourt advantage in the playoffs, while the Pacers continue to battle for a favorable playoff position in the Eastern Conference. Highlighting the Thunder's depth, Isaiah Joe's back-to-back 3-pointers late in the third quarter helped to put the game out of reach. Despite Tyrese Haliburton's 18 points for the Pacers, Indiana struggled to replicate their recent high-scoring performances against Oklahoma City.

Despite trailing momentarily early in the first quarter, Boston maintained control for most of the game, holding the Spurs to just 4-for-13 shooting from three in the opening period.
