**Utah Hockey Club 1 - 2 Dallas Stars**  
In a tightly contested match, Casey DeSmith made an impressive 34 saves to secure the Dallas Stars' 2-1 victory over the Utah Hockey Club in Salt Lake City, marking his first win since October 24. The Stars took a decisive lead with goals from Evgenii Dadonov, who scored on a power play, and Jamie Benn, extending their victory streak to three games. Despite a strong offensive push from Utah, including a goal by Nick Schmaltz who has now scored three times in his last two games following a lengthy drought, DeSmith's performance was pivotal for Dallas, particularly in the absence of rest after playing back-to-back games. Utah's persistence was evident as they saw their three-game point streak snap, highlighting the Stars' ability to defend well under pressure and overcome fatigue, as noted by both coaches. Additionally, the game was marked by Utah defenseman Mikhail Sergachev's milestone of playing in his 500th NHL game.
