**Vancouver Canucks 3 - 5 Nashville Predators**  
In an exciting NHL matchup, Steven Stamkos scored twice on the power play to lead the Nashville Predators to a 5-3 victory over the Vancouver Canucks at Rogers Arena. This marked the first time this season Nashville scored more than three goals in a road game, snapping their previous streak of scoring two goals or fewer in each of their last six away matches. Roman Josi contributed a goal and an assist, while Filip Forsberg had two assists and Zachary L'Heureux netted his first NHL goal, sparking the Predators' offense. Despite Elias Pettersson's and Aatu Raty's goals for Vancouver, the Canucks couldn't capitalize on home advantage, dropping to a 3-4-3 home record. Kevin Lankinen, facing his former team, made 16 saves for Vancouver, but it was his Predators counterpart Juuse Saros who outshone with 24 saves, securing the win. Zachary L’Heureux's opening goal came from an amusing mishap where a missed shot landed perfectly for him, setting the tone for Nashville's resilient effort. Despite a late goal by Vancouver's Kiefer Sherwood, an empty-netter by Gustav Nyquist sealed the game for Nashville.

**Vegas Golden Knights 2 - 5 Washington Capitals**  
Alex Ovechkin's electrifying hat trick led the Washington Capitals to a 5-2 victory over the Vegas Golden Knights at T-Mobile Arena. This marked Ovechkin's 31st career hat trick, bringing him closer to Wayne Gretzky's all-time NHL record of 894 goals, with Ovechkin now just 29 goals shy. Meanwhile, Logan Thompson, who was recently traded to the Capitals from Vegas, shone in his return to Las Vegas with 40 saves, while Jakob Chychrun and Jakub Vrana also found the net for Washington. Despite goals from Brett Howden and Keegan Kolesar, Vegas couldn't overcome an early deficit, with their coach, Bruce Cassidy, lamenting missed opportunities. Ovechkin's remarkable feat places him one hat trick away from tying Phil Esposito for the fifth-most in NHL history, shared only with legends like Mario Lemieux and Marcel Dionne.

**Seattle Kraken 0 - 2 New York Rangers**  
Quick makes 24 saves, gets 2nd straight shutout for Rangers in win against Kraken 
 <forge-entity title="Jonathan Quick" slug="jonathan-quick-8471734" code="player">Jonathan Quick</forge-entity> made 24 saves for his second shutout in as many starts, and the New York Rangers ended the Seattle Kraken's four-game winning streak, 2-0 at Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle on Sunday. 
Quick stopped all 37 shots he faced in a 4-0 win at the Detroit Red Wings on Nov. 9. He has an active shutout streak of 128:05 dating to a relief appearance in a 6-1 loss to the Buffalo Sabres on Nov. 7.

Zac Jones scored his first goal of the season, and Alexis Lafreniere got his seventh. Artemi Panarin had an assist to extend his point streak to seven games (four goals, five assists). The Rangers (11-4-1) won their second straight game and third in four.

Philipp Grubauer made 21 saves in his first start in five games since Nov. 5. The Kraken (9-9-1) were shutout for the fourth time this season.

Lafreniere gave the Rangers a 1-0 lead at 17:30 of the second period, scoring a backdoor tap-in off a centering pass from Panarin along the left-side boards.

Panarin cut off the Kraken's slow clearing attempt on the wall and sifted a pass through the slot to Lafreniere, who was open at the right post. All Lafreniere had to do was keep his stick down on the ice to redirect the puck past Grubauer.

Brandon Tanev had a breakaway less than two minutes later, but K'Andre Miller made a strong defensive play on the backcheck at 19:20, knocking the puck away from the Kraken forward before he got a chance to shoot or make a move on Quick.

Quick previously kept it 0-0 with a save on Jaden Schwartz's wraparound attempt at 5:01 and with a right pad stop on Chandler Stephenson's shot from the left post off an end-wall rebound at 14:13.

Jones extended the Rangers' lead to 2-0 at 2:58 of the third period, scoring off the rush with a shot from the left face-off circle that squeezed through Grubauer, trickling in under his left arm.
