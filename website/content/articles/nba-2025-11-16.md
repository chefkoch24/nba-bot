**Cleveland Cavaliers 108 - 100 Memphis Grizzlies**  
The Cleveland Cavaliers secured a 108-100 win over the Memphis Grizzlies, primarily thanks to a late-game surge led by Donovan Mitchell, who scored 30 points, with 14 coming in a crucial four-minute stretch in the fourth quarter. The Cavaliers, who trailed for most of the game, executed a 17-2 run, shifting the score to 103-92 with just over three minutes left. Evan Mobley contributed significantly for Cleveland with 22 points and 13 rebounds. Despite Jaren Jackson Jr.'s 26 points for Memphis, which included tying his career high with 12 made free throws, the Grizzlies struggled, as Jackson shot only 6 of 23 from the field. Notably, Zach Edey made his season debut, adding 13 points and seven rebounds after recovering from ankle surgery. Memphis faced further challenges with point guard Ja Morant exiting early due to right calf soreness. The Cavaliers, missing key players like Darius Garland and Jaylon Tyson, leveled their record to 1-1 on a six-game homestand.

The Raptors, now 6-3 on the road and 8-5 overall, overcame a depleted Pacers team missing key starters due to injuries. Andrew Nembhard and Pascal Siakam led the effort for Indiana, the latter scoring 30 points with five 3-pointers. The Pacers, struggling at 1-12 this season, faced further setbacks with guard Aaron Nesmith out for at least a month.

**Milwaukee Bucks 95 - 119 Los Angeles Lakers**  
Luka Doncic shone with 41 points and nine rebounds, leading the Los Angeles Lakers to a decisive 119-95 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks. Austin Reaves contributed 25 points and eight assists, while Deandre Ayton added a double-double with 20 points and 10 rebounds. Despite playing without key players like LeBron James, Rui Hachimura, and Marcus Smart, the Lakers dominated early, building a substantial 65-34 halftime lead. Giannis Antetokounmpo's 32 points and 10 rebounds weren’t enough to lift the Bucks, who struggled with first-half shooting, hitting only 24% from the field. AJ Green's three-point shooting helped Milwaukee rally slightly, but Doncic’s late surge maintained the Lakers' comfort. The Bucks were unable to shake their cold shooting, ultimately scoring a season-low, and faced difficulties overcoming the Lakers' consistent offense.

**Minnesota Timberwolves 92 - 95 Denver Nuggets**  
The Denver Nuggets secured their seventh consecutive win by defeating the Minnesota Timberwolves 123-112, with standout performances from Tim Hardaway Jr. and Nikola Jokic. The game faced a technical hiccup when the NBA's courtside statistics system froze late in the third quarter due to a double-foul input. Despite missing starting forwards Christian Braun, who is out for at least six weeks, and Cam Johnson, the Nuggets continued their strong form against the Timberwolves, having won both encounters this season after being swept in the regular-season series the previous year. The Nuggets rallied from an eight-point halftime deficit with a 45-point third-quarter surge, showcasing their resilience. Both teams are set to host other opponents on Monday, with the Nuggets facing the Chicago Bulls and the Timberwolves set to play the Dallas Mavericks.
