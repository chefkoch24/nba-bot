**St Louis Blues 2 - 4 Buffalo Sabres**  
Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen's stellar performance with 35 saves propelled the Buffalo Sabres to a 4-2 victory over the St. Louis Blues, marking their third consecutive win. Key contributors for the Sabres included Tage Thompson and Jason Zucker, who both notched a goal and an assist, while Jack Quinn provided two assists. Buffalo's special teams were decisive, scoring two power-play goals, with Zucker's power-play one-timer proving pivotal in regaining the lead at 3-2. Jiri Kulich added another goal securing the win. In contrast, the Blues struggled, particularly on special teams, failing to convert any of their four power-play opportunities, much to the dissatisfaction of coach Jim Montgomery. Despite goals from Brayden Schenn and Nathan Walker, St. Louis couldn't secure a third straight win and now prepares to face the Chicago Blackhawks in the upcoming NHL Winter Classic. Notably, the Sabres have outscored opponents 17-5 during their winning streak, while the Blues' Colton Parayko extended his point streak to three games, and Jordan Kyrou's point streak at home came to an end.
