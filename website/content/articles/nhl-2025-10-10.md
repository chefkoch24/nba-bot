**Vancouver Canucks 5 - 1 Calgary Flames**  
In an exhilarating season opener, the Calgary Flames rebounded from a 4-1 deficit to defeat the Vancouver Canucks 6-5 in overtime at Rogers Arena, thanks to Connor Zary's decisive goal. The Flames showcased resilience, clawing back with four consecutive goals, including three in the third period, to briefly lead before J.T. Miller's late equalizer forced overtime. Noteworthy performances included Anthony Mantha's short-handed goal, contributions from Rasmus Andersson, Martin Pospisil, and multi-assists from Nazem Kadri. Calgary's comeback was fueled by a strong second period, where they outshot Vancouver 11-3. Despite their strong start, the Canucks, led by Brock Boeser's two goals and assisted by Quinn Hughes, struggled to maintain momentum as Calgary's elevated intensity ultimately outmatched them. Flames coach Ryan Huska credited the team's shift in approach and composure as vital to their victory. Meanwhile, notable moments included Daniel Sprong's early goal for Vancouver, Miller's 800th NHL game, and Jake DeBruskâ€™s debut assist.
