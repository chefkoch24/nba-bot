**Chicago Blackhawks 2 - 6 New York Rangers**  
In an impressive comeback win, the New York Rangers defeated the Chicago Blackhawks 6-2, led by Filip Chytil's two goals. The Rangers, who had been struggling, reversed a 1-0 deficit with five consecutive goals, including contributions from Vincent Trocheck, Jonny Brodzinski, Will Borgen, and Reilly Smith. The game marked Louis Domingue’s first NHL start of the season, where he made 25 saves. Despite an early goal by Tyler Bertuzzi and an assist extending Connor Bedard's point streak to seven games for the Blackhawks, Chicago faltered after poor puck management led to defensive lapses. Wyatt Kaiser notched his first NHL goal for Chicago, but the team's recent form has seen them lose six out of seven games. Adam Fox also surpassed Brad Park for the third-most assists by a Rangers defenseman, while Borgen scored his first goal for New York after being traded from Seattle.

**Boston Bruins 4 - 5 New York Islanders**  
The New York Islanders ended their three-game losing streak with an exciting 5-4 overtime win against the Boston Bruins at TD Garden. Bo Horvat was the hero, scoring twice, including the game-winner in overtime after Islanders goalie Ilya Sorokin made a crucial pad save. Despite David Pastrnak's efforts, scoring two goals to tie the game in regulation, the Bruins suffered their fourth consecutive loss. Anders Lee contributed two goals, and Ryan Pulock added one goal and two assists for the Islanders. Notably, Sorokin's 26 saves included a key stop against Pastrnak in overtime, marking his 107th career win, which placed him fourth in Islanders history. On the Bruins' side, Pastrnak made history by becoming the fourth player in team history to score two-plus goals on consecutive days multiple times, joining legends like Phil Esposito and Cam Neely. Despite these individual performances, the game was hailed by both sides as one showcasing resilience and team effort.

Seth Jarvis netted two goals for the Hurricanes, helping to erase a disappointing 4-0 loss to the Minnesota Wild the previous night. Erik Karlsson was a standout for the Penguins with a goal and an assist, but Pittsburgh's efforts fell short as they concluded a road trip with a 0-1-2 record.

The game saw Jake McCabe leaving due to an injury after a fight with Garnet Hathaway, echoing a similar previous accident. The Flyers, losing two in a row, were competitive with goals from Tyson Foerster and Scott Laughton, and goalie Ivan Fedotov making 22 saves in his first start since December 5.

John Gibson reached a milestone, securing his 200th NHL victory with 36 saves, and Troy Terry contributed a goal and an assist. Despite outshooting Anaheim in the latter periods, the Lightning struggled offensively, scoring only one goal through Jake Guentzel and losing their fourth consecutive game. Tampa Bay's penalty kill remained perfect, but their overall offensive woes continued, causing concern for coach Jon Cooper. The Ducks have found a rhythm, winning four of their last five games.
