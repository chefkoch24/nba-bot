**Kansas City Chiefs 30 - 24 Tampa Bay Buccaneers**  
In a thrilling "Monday Night Football" matchup, the Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 30-24 in overtime, with Patrick Mahomes throwing three touchdown passes despite tweaking his ankle. Kareem Hunt finished with 106 rushing yards and secured the win with a 2-yard touchdown run in overtime. DeAndre Hopkins was impactful in his first home game as a Chief, catching eight passes for 86 yards and two touchdowns. Travis Kelce also had a standout performance, making 14 catches for 100 yards under the watchful eye of Taylor Swift in the stands. The Chiefs extended their winning streak to 14 games, including a perfect 8-0 start to the current season. Tampa Bay, led by Baker Mayfield, forced overtime with a late touchdown pass, but Coach Todd Bowles' decision to kick the extra point for the tie instead of a 2-point conversion for the win ultimately led to their fourth loss in five games. Rachaad White scored for the Buccaneers in a memorable moment during his first game at Arrowhead Stadium, marking his journey from a local Kansas City resident to an NFL player.
