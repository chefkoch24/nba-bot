**Denver Nuggets 99 - 106 Minnesota Timberwolves**  
Anthony Edwards put on a show, scoring a playoff career-high 43 points to lead the Timberwolves to a 106-99 Game 1 victory over the Nuggets. Naz Reid erupted in the fourth quarter with 14 of his 16 points, while Karl-Anthony Towns added 20 points. Minnesota shot a scorching 71.1% in the second half. Despite Nikola Jokic's 32 points for Denver, the Nuggets had trouble containing Edwards. Timberwolves coach Chris Finch returned to the bench just days after knee surgery, and Denver coach Michael Malone praised Edwards' all-around game. Game 2 will be in Denver on Monday.
