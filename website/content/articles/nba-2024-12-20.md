**Sacramento Kings 100 - 113 Los Angeles Lakers**  
In anticipation of their matchup against the Sacramento Kings, the Los Angeles Lakers, formerly dethroned NBA Cup champions, aim for a more significant achievement post-NBA Cup with LeBron James's potential return remaining uncertain. The NBA break allowed James to recuperate his ailing left foot, and though he contributed significantly in the Lakers' recent win over Memphis, coach JJ Redick plans to limit his court time to shorter stints rather than fewer minutes to prevent exhaustion. As the Lakers and Kings, both struggling in recent games, battle for positions amid a seven-team race for sixth in the Western Conference, Sacramento seeks to improve their defensive play after a narrow loss to Denver. The Kings, hindered by injury uncertainties concerning Keegan Murray, Kevin Huerter, and Domantas Sabonis, face a tactical challenge against Anthony Davis in upcoming back-to-back games with the Lakers.
