In an exciting Western Conference showdown, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Oklahoma City Thunder to a convincing 127-103 victory over the Denver Nuggets, marking their seventh consecutive win and solidifying their spot at the top of the conference with a 53-11 record.

Jalen Williams contributed significantly with 26 points, nine rebounds, and eight assists. Despite Nikola Jokicâ€™s strong effort for Denver with 24 points, 13 rebounds, and nine assists, he struggled against Oklahoma City's towering defense by Chet Holmgren and Isaiah Hartenstein. A pivotal moment came when Aaron Wiggins intercepted a pass, leading to a critical Holmgren dunk and extending the Thunder's lead. Denver's early 10-0 run wasn't enough as the Thunder overcame the deficit by the end of the first quarter.

**Dallas Mavericks 116 - 125 Phoenix Suns**  
In a closely contested game, the Phoenix Suns defeated the shorthanded Dallas Mavericks 125-116, with Devin Booker leading the charge with 24 points. Kevin Durant nearly recorded a triple-double, contributing 21 points, nine rebounds, and eight assists, while Bradley Beal added 19 points. Grayson Allen chipped in 17 points as the Suns moved closer to the Mavericks in the playoff race. Despite a career-high 34 points from Naji Marshall, the Mavericks struggled after losing key players, including Dwight Powell and Kessler Edwards, due to injuries during the game. The Suns capitalized with a decisive 19-2 run to establish a lead they never relinquished and shot an impressive 58% from the field. Notably, Mason Plumlee executed five dunks, exploiting Dallas's rim protection issues. Dallas's defeat extended their losing streak to five and marked the first time they dropped below .500 since mid-November, exacerbated by Kyrie Irving's absence due to a season-ending injury. Both teams were poised to face more challenges with back-to-back games the following day.

The Cleveland Cavaliers extended their winning streak to 14 games by defeating the Milwaukee Bucks 112-100 on Sunday night, led by Max Strus's 17 points as part of a balanced scoring effort.

Despite Giannis Antetokounmpo's impressive 30-point performance, which moved him into 50th place on the NBA's career scoring list, the Bucks couldn't overcome the Cavs' depth and three-point shooting dominance, with Cleveland outscoring Milwaukee 57-27 from beyond the arc. The Bucks, playing their second game in as many nights, struggled against top Eastern Conference teams and are set to face a string of challenging opponents in their upcoming games.

In a thrilling matchup, the Detroit Pistons held off the Portland Trail Blazers for a 119-112 victory in Portland. Cade Cunningham led Detroit with 28 points, while Tobias Harris contributed 20 points on an efficient 9-of-13 shooting. Jalen Duren added a significant double-double with 18 points and 12 rebounds.

Despite Anfernee Simons' impressive 34-point performance for Portland, which included 14-of-26 shooting, and Jerami Grant's 25 points, the Blazers struggled with consistency, particularly from three-point range, where they connected on only 30% of their shots. The high-foul game saw both teams combining for 64 free throw attempts. Detroit withstood a late Portland rally, boosted by Dennis Schroder's late floater, ultimately concluding their four-game road trip with a win.

Kawhi Leonard's dramatic buzzer-beating hook shot secured a 111-110 overtime victory for the Los Angeles Clippers over the Sacramento Kings, tightening their hold on eighth place in the Western Conference.

The Kings' inability to maintain their seven-point lead in the final minutes of regulation led to the overtime, where LaVine and DeRozan combined for all of Sacramento's points. The game was also marked by Clippers' coach Tyronn Lue's absence due to back pain, with assistant Brian Shaw stepping in. The Kings struggled with 3-point shooting, going 9 of 34, whereas the Clippers only slightly outshot them with 10 of 31.
