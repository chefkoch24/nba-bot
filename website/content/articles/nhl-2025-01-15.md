**Washington Capitals 3 - 0 Anaheim Ducks**  
Thompson makes 19 saves, Capitals shut out Ducks to extend point streak to 8 games
 **WASHINGTON** \-\- <forge-entity title="Logan Thompson" slug="logan-thompson-8480313" code="player">Logan Thompson</forge-entity> made 19 saves, and the Washington Capitals extended their point streak to eight games with a 3-0 win against the Anaheim Ducks at Capital One Arena on Tuesday. 
<forge-entity title="Brandon Duhaime" slug="brandon-duhaime-8479520" code="player">Brandon Duhaime</forge-entity> had a goal and an assist for the Capitals (29-10-5), who are 5-0-3 in their past eight games, and 8-0-3 in their past 11 home games. Thompson improved to 19-2-3 and recorded his first shutout as a Capital and fifth of his career.

"I'm good at letting in one \[goal\], so I can never seem to get them,” Thompson said of the shutout. “It's always a treat when I do." 
<forge-entity title="John Gibson" slug="john-gibson-8476434" code="player">John Gibson</forge-entity> made 22 saves for the Ducks (18-21-5), who have lost four of five (1-3-1) overall and three of four on their six-game road trip.

“We’re not shooting a ton of pucks,” Anaheim forward Alex Killorn said. “Our goalies keep us in every single game and we’ve got to find ways to score. We score two goals a game, so it’s got to come from within us winning battles, being better in the O zone, creating more chances.”

The Capitals took a 1-0 lead at 7:34 when Jakob Chychrun’s shot off his own rebound deflected in off Duhaime’s skate.

John Carlson made it 2-0 at 14:30, gathering in a loose puck and beating Gibson with a wrist shot from the right circle.

“I thought that was one of the best periods we’ve played in a long time,” Capitals coach Spencer Carbery said of the opening 20 minutes. “Second period we got away from it and \[Thompson\] had to bail us out.” 
Ethen Frank increased the lead to 3-0 at 19:01 of the second period, receiving a pass from Pierre-Luc Dubois on a 2-on-1 rush and scoring with a glove-side wrist shot from the right circle.

“Tonight, we gave up a couple 2-on-1s and partial breakaways,” Ducks coach Greg Cronin said. “Their third goal, which was a backbreaker, we pinched down the wall and we didn’t have somebody to replace for the pincher and it ended up being a 2-on-1 goal.”

Frank, 26, has two goals and an assist in his first three NHL games.

"He's been great,” Carlson said. “More than just the tallies and stuff, I think he seems to be a positive impact every time he steps on the ice. Obviously, a guy with speed like that is a threat no matter where he is. It's great to see. It's a great story, and we're relying on him big right now.”

**NOTES:** Frank is the sixth player in Capitals franchise history to record a point in each of his first three NHL games, joining Alex Ovechkin (eight games in 2005-06), Andre Burakovsky (four games in 2014-15), Milan Novy (four games in 1982-83), Ryan Walter (four games in 1978-79) and Jan Bulis (three games in 1997-98). … Capitals center Nic Dowd won 8-of-10 faceoffs. … Dubois has recorded 20 points (five goals, 15 assists) in his last 21 games. … Ducks forward Troy Terry played 18:49 and was minus-1 in his return after missing four games for personal reasons.

**Columbus Blue Jackets 3 - 2 Philadelphia Flyers**  
The Columbus Blue Jackets secured their fifth consecutive victory with a 3-2 shootout win over the Philadelphia Flyers, highlighted by Zach Werenski's late-game heroics at Nationwide Arena. Werenski, who scored twice to tie the game in the third period, missed a potential hat trick with a saved shot in overtime. Daniil Tarasov contributed 23 saves in his first start since December, while Kent Johnson and Kirill Marchenko scored in the shootout. Marchenko also extended his point streak to five games. For Philadelphia, Bobby Brink ended his 21-game goal drought with an early lead, and Owen Tippett added another goal. Despite Ivan Fedotov’s 26 saves, the Flyers fell short, with coach John Tortorella acknowledging the fatigue from their previous night's game. Werenski's efforts also placed him among the elite, being only the seventh defenseman in NHL history with a home point streak of at least 17 games, a list that includes legends like Bobby Orr.

**New York Islanders 0 - 2 Ottawa Senators**  
Merilainen makes 24 saves, Senators blank Islanders
 **ELMONT, N.Y. --** <forge-entity title="Leevi Merilainen" slug="leevi-merilainen-8482447" code="player">Leevi Merilainen</forge-entity> made 24 saves for the Ottawa Senators in a 2-0 win against the New York Islanders at UBS Arena on Tuesday. 
It was Merilainen's second shutout in his past three starts. He made 29 saves in a 5-0 win at the Pittsburgh Penguins on Saturday.

“He's doing an excellent job right now, and we're so happy for him,” Ottawa defenseman <forge-entity title="Tyler Kleven" slug="tyler-kleven-8482095" code="player">Tyler Kleven</forge-entity> said. “He works so hard every day. I watched it all last year in Belleville (Ottawa’s American Hockey League affiliate). I knew he was a good goalie, and now he's getting this opportunity here in Ottawa and he's just playing his game and being who he is. So, it's great to see.”

<forge-entity title="Adam Gaudette" slug="adam-gaudette-8478874" code="player">Adam Gaudette</forge-entity> and <forge-entity title="Artem Zub" slug="artem-zub-8482245" code="player">Artem Zub</forge-entity> scored for the Senators (22-18-3), who have won three straight.

“I think it was just about staying with it,” Ottawa coach Travis Green said. “We talked about how, in these types of games, details and puck battles are really going to matter. Every inch of the ice is important, and I know we had buy-in from everyone.” 
<forge-entity title="Marcus Hogberg" slug="marcus-hogberg-8477405" code="player">Marcus Hogberg</forge-entity> made 25 saves in his second straight start for the Islanders (17-19-7), who had their three-game winning streak end.

New York was shut out for the sixth time this season.

“I’m going to give them some credit, they did a good job boxing us out,” Islanders coach Patrick Roy said. “But, I mean, we didn't go to the net enough. We didn't generate enough offense by throwing pucks at the net. Maybe we tried to be a little too perfect.”

Gaudette thought he scored the opening goal for Ottawa at 1:42 of the first period, but New York challenged the play for goaltender interference, and the call was reversed after a video review.

Gaudette did, however, make it 1-0 at 8:42 of the second period by redirecting Kleven's point shot over Hogberg’s blocker from the top of the crease.

“It felt good for sure,” said Gaudette, who ended a 15-game goal drought. “Everybody gets cold streaks. That's the way it is, in the game and in life. So, what you got to do is just keep your head down, keep working and eventually it'll go in.” 
Merilainen kept Ottawa in front at 4:20 of the third period when he kicked out his left pad to stop <forge-entity title="Ryan Pulock" slug="ryan-pulock-8477506" code="player">Ryan Pulock</forge-entity>'s wrist shot from the slot. He then stopped <forge-entity title="Brock Nelson" slug="brock-nelson-8475754" code="player">Brock Nelson</forge-entity> off the rush at 12:40 with his blocker.

Zub scored into an empty net at 18:36 of the third for the 2-0 final.

“There wasn’t a ton in the game,” Islanders captain <forge-entity title="Anders Lee" slug="anders-lee-8475314" code="player">Anders Lee</forge-entity> said. “It was one of those night where I don’t think we did a ton wrong. We didn’t do enough special to break through and put one in. It felt like a choppy game. We tried to push through and play a little simpler in the third. That’s how we tried to play the whole game, but we just couldn’t create enough.”

Ottawa defenseman <forge-entity title="Thomas Chabot" slug="thomas-chabot-8478469" code="player">Thomas Chabot</forge-entity> left the game at 9:50 of the first period after he took a point shot from <forge-entity title="Adam Pelech" slug="adam-pelech-8476917" code="player">Adam Pelech</forge-entity> to the face. There was no update postgame.

“When Chabot went out, the guys really stepped up,” Green said. “Kleven played a lot more minutes than he’s really used to. Really, all five guys back there were impressive. Zub had seven blocked shots. His game is starting to round out into shape now that he’s playing a lot, and we can see how effective he can be.”

**NOTES:** The Islanders were 0-for-1 on the power play and are 0-for-25 with the man-advantage in their past 14 games. Their last power-play goal came in a 4-2 win against the Senators on Dec. 8. ... Islanders defenseman <forge-entity title="Alexander Romanov" slug="alexander-romanov-8481014" code="player">Alexander Romanov</forge-entity> missed his second straight game with an upper-body injury, and forward <forge-entity title="Jean-Gabriel Pageau" slug="jean-gabriel-pageau-8476419" code="player">Jean-Gabriel Pageau</forge-entity> missed the game because of an illness. ...
