**Los Angeles Chargers 23 - 30 Baltimore Ravens**  
In a thrilling Monday night matchup, Lamar Jackson led the Baltimore Ravens to a 30-23 victory over the Los Angeles Chargers, accounting for three touchdowns and helping coach John Harbaugh maintain an unbeaten 3-0 record against his brother Jim. The game marked the first meeting between the Harbaugh brothers since Super Bowl 47. Baltimore trailed 10-0 before scoring on five consecutive drives, with Jackson connecting on key plays, including a 40-yard touchdown pass to Rashod Bateman. Derrick Henry contributed significantly with 140 rushing yards even though he didn’t score. Justice Hill’s 51-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter sealed the win, snapping the Chargers’ four-game winning streak. Despite his early knee injury, J.K. Dobbins' absence led the Chargers to rely heavily on passer Justin Herbert, who completed 21 of 36 passes. The Ravens outgained the Chargers, racking up 389 yards, and now hold an 8-4 record. Both teams face challenging upcoming games, with the Ravens hosting Philadelphia and the Chargers heading to Atlanta.
