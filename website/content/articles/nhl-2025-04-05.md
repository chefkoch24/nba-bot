**Washington Capitals 5 - 3 Chicago Blackhawks**  
In a thrilling matchup at Capital One Arena, Alex Ovechkin tied Wayne Gretzky’s NHL record for most goals in history by scoring his 893rd and 894th career goals, leading the Washington Capitals to a 5-3 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks. With Gretzky watching from the stands, Ovechkin not only tied the legendary record but also set a new milestone by breaking a tie with Jaromir Jagr for the most game-winning goals in NHL history, marking his 136th such goal. Dylan Strome contributed a goal and an assist, while Ryan Leonard, playing just his third NHL game, scored his first goal to seal the win with an empty-netter. The Blackhawks, despite leading 3-2 entering the third period, were unable to quash the Capitals' comeback, faltering due to penalties and momentum shifts driven by the home crowd's energy. The game also highlighted Ovechkin's enduring prowess as the first NHL player with three 40-goal seasons after the age of 35, capping a historic night for Washington’s captain.
