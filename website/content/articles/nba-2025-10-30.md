**Minnesota Timberwolves 115 - 116 Los Angeles Lakers**  
Austin Reaves was the hero for the Los Angeles Lakers, as he hit a 12-foot game-winning shot just before the buzzer sounded, securing a 116-115 win against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Reaves tied his career high with 16 assists and finished with 28 points, contributing significantly in a game that saw the Lakers missing key players like Luka Doncic and LeBron James.

Jaden McDaniels added 30 points and seven rebounds for Minnesota. Despite missing four of their five primary ballhandlers, the Lakers leaned on Reaves, who also had a spectacular performance earlier in the week, including a 51-point game against Sacramento. The game also saw interesting interactions with Anthony Edwards engaging in sideline chatter, including some trash talk with Jake LaRavia. This victory adds to the Lakers' resilience as they prepare to face Memphis on Friday, while the Timberwolves head to Charlotte on Saturday.

Morant, who contributed significantly with 28 points, including the decisive 11-foot jumper with 7.6 seconds left, guided Memphis to their sixth consecutive victory over Phoenix. Despite Devin Booker's fourth-quarter heroics, scoring 16 of his 32 points, his potential game-winning 3-pointer missed at the buzzer. Phoenix fought back from a 99-89 deficit to temporarily lead, thanks to Mark Williams' dunk, but Morant's late basket sealed the game for Memphis.
