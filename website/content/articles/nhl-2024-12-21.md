**Buffalo Sabres 3 - 6 Toronto Maple Leafs**  
In his first NHL game since April 2023, Matt Murray made an impressive 24 saves for the Toronto Maple Leafs, marking his return with a 6-3 victory over the Buffalo Sabres. After recovering from bilateral hip surgery in October, this win was Murray's first in the NHL since March 2023. Supporting him, William Nylander had a standout performance with a goal and two assists, while Bobby McMann, Max Domi, and Nicholas Robertson each contributed a goal and an assist. Despite a strong showing from Toronto, the Sabres extended their losing streak to 12 games, with poor puck management cited as a key issue. Notably, Toronto's balanced attack saw contributions from Mitch Marner and John Tavares, the latter reaching 600 career assists, while McMann, Domi, and Robertson continued their strong form, amassing 16 points over the last three games.

**Detroit Red Wings 3 - 4 Montreal Canadiens**  
In a closely contested game at Little Caesars Arena, the Montreal Canadiens edged out the Detroit Red Wings 4-3, thanks to a decisive power-play goal by Patrik Laine with just under eight minutes left in the third period. The Canadiens, featuring goals from Emil Heineman and Jake Evans, who both also tallied assists, marked the first time this season with more than 30 shots, with goalie Sam Montembeault making 25 saves to secure the win. Despite a strong effort including goals by Patrick Kane and Tyler Motte, and an assist duo by Michael Rasmussen for the Red Wings, they failed to capitalize on their special teams and missed a key victory. Red Wings coach Derek Lalonde lamented their special teams' shortcomings, underscoring a missed opportunity, while Montreal highlighted the debut performance of Alexandre Carrier, newly acquired from Nashville. Dylan Larkin emphasized the chance for immediate revenge as both teams are set to face off again the following day in Montreal.

Uvis Balinskis notched his first goal of the season to tie the game, adding excitement with his family in attendance. The Panthers, backed by Sergei Bobrovsky's 26 saves, extended their winning streak, while the Blues struggled with their third consecutive loss.

**Washington Capitals 3 - 1 Carolina Hurricanes**  
In a tight contest at Capital One Arena, the Washington Capitals defeated the Carolina Hurricanes 3-1, ending their two-game losing streak. Charlie Lindgren stood out with a stellar performance, making 24 crucial saves, including a highlight windmilling glove save that evoked comparisons to legendary goalie Dominik Hasek. Washington's scoring was initiated by Aliaksei Protas, who tipped in the first goal late in the first period, followed by goals from Jakub Vrana and Connor McMichael, each finding the net with well-executed plays. Despite Seth Jarvis pulling one back for the Hurricanes, their struggle on the road persisted with a sixth consecutive away loss. The game marked McMichael's ascendance as he surpassed the injured Alex Ovechkin to become the team's leading goal scorer with 16 for the season, showcasing the depth of scoring talent within the Capitals' lineup. The Hurricanes' Pyotr Kochetkov had 19 saves, but crucial lapses cost them dearly, especially as the Capitals capitalized in the final minutes of the first and second periods.

**Dallas Stars 1 - 3 New York Rangers**  
In a spirited matchup at the American Airlines Center, Igor Shesterkin delivered an impressive 41-save performance to steer the New York Rangers to a 3-1 victory over the Dallas Stars, snapping their three-game losing streak. The Rangers' win was bolstered by Vincent Trocheck, who contributed a goal and an assist, as well as shorthanded and empty-net goals from Reilly Smith and Chris Kreider. The Stars, despite Roope Hintz's early goal, struggled mightily on the power play, failing to convert on seven opportunities, including a five-minute major advantage. Dallas coach Pete DeBoer acknowledged the challenge, noting the power play's ineffectiveness as a momentum breaker. Meanwhile, Artemi Panarin returned to the Rangers lineup after an injury, adding an assist to his team's resilient performance.

**Minnesota Wild 1 - 2 Utah Hockey Club**  
Dylan Guenther continued his impressive form by scoring twice, including the decisive goal during a power play in the third period, as the Utah Hockey Club edged past the Minnesota Wild 2-1, extending their point streak to seven games. Guenther's sixth goal in a four-game streak marked an NHL career high for him. Karel Vejmelka contributed significantly with 28 saves for Utah, who are on a winning streak, having secured victories in six of their last seven games. Despite a goal from Mats Zuccarello that put Minnesota ahead initially, the Wild could not maintain their lead, losing their third straight game. A potential Utah lead by Jack McBain was nullified due to a successful Minnesota challenge, calling out goaltender interference. Utah's strong defensive play, particularly against Minnesota's top players in the latter half, was praised by their coach Andre Tourigny. Guenther's performance was also noteworthy as he recorded his fifth multigoal game of the season, tying for the second most in the NHL this season.

The Ducks, attempting to match their season-high winning streak, were initially ahead after Leo Carlsson's goal, but the Avalanche quickly responded and took control. Alex Killorn's late goal brought Anaheim within reach, but MacKinnon's empty-netter sealed the win for Colorado. The game also featured a notable first point for Jacob Trouba with the Ducks following his trade from the New York Rangers.
