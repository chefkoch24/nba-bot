**Indiana Pacers 121 - 118 Milwaukee Bucks**  
The Indiana Pacers defeated the Milwaukee Bucks 121-118 in overtime, taking a 2-1 series lead thanks to a clutch three-point play by Tyrese Haliburton in the final seconds. Despite struggling with his shooting, Haliburton recorded a triple-double with 18 points, 16 assists, and 10 rebounds, while Myles Turner added a playoff-career high 29 points. Khris Middleton also had a standout performance for the Bucks with a playoff-career high 42 points, but it wasn't enough as Giannis Antetokounmpo sat out with a calf injury. The Pacers secured their first back-to-back postseason wins since 2014 in a thrilling game that saw Damian Lillard shine despite injuries.

**Phoenix Suns 99 - 114 Minnesota Timberwolves**  
The Phoenix Suns returned home in a critical situation against the series-leading Minnesota Timberwolves, down 2-0 in the Western Conference first-round series. The Suns have struggled to respond to the Timberwolves' aggressive defense, being dominated in points off turnovers and failing to reach 30 points in a single quarter. While the star trio of Booker, Durant, and Beal have struggled, Minnesota's collective effort, led by McDaniels and Gobert, has propelled them to a 2-0 series lead. With time running out, the Suns must regroup at home to avoid being swept and assert themselves in the series.

**Dallas Mavericks 101 - 90 LA Clippers**  
Luka Doncic led the defensive-minded Mavericks to a chippy 101-90 victory over the Clippers, taking a 2-1 series lead. Doncic had 22 points, 10 rebounds, and nine assists, while Daniel Gafford and Dereck Lively II provided impactful defense with rim protection and dunks. The game featured five technical fouls, a flagrant foul, and two ejections, including Russell Westbrook and P.J. Washington. Kawhi Leonard struggled in his second game back from injury, and the Clippers had 19 turnovers. Kyrie Irving helped the Mavericks rebuild an 18-point lead with 21 points. Despite Doncic's shooting struggles, Dallas held George and Westbrook to one 3-pointer combined and limited Leonard's impact. This physical series is expected to become more mental as it progresses, with both teams competing intensely for the win.
