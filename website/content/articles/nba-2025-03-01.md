**Detroit Pistons 119 - 134 Denver Nuggets**  
Nikola Jokic recorded a triple-double with 23 points, 17 rebounds, and 15 assists, leading the Denver Nuggets to a 134-119 victory over the Detroit Pistons, ending Detroit's eight-game winning streak. Jamal Murray contributed significantly with 31 points, while Michael Porter Jr. added 28 and Christian Braun matched Jokic with 23 points for Denver, which has won 11 of their last 13 games. Although Malik Beasley scored 16 points off the bench for Detroit, their starters struggled, being outscored 113-54. The Nuggets took control with a strong third-quarter run, extending a five-point halftime lead to 107-87 entering the fourth. Jokic's efficiency was evident despite erratic shooting, as he drew multiple fouls to impact Detroit's frontcourt and facilitated Denver's high scoring, having already tallied near triple-double numbers by halftime. The Pistons' recent successful months couldn't stave off a poor shooting night and Denver's scoring onslaught, particularly in the first and third quarters.

Jayson Tatum's impressive first half, with 30 points, nine rebounds, and seven assists, marked a historic feat as he became the first player to achieve such stats in a half during the play-by-play era. Jaylen Brown also shone with 37 points, yet Boston could not hold onto their lead. This victory serves as a substantial boost for the Cavs, who had previously been ousted by Boston in the playoffs.

**Miami Heat 125 - 120 Indiana Pacers**  
The Miami Heat narrowly defeated the Indiana Pacers 125-120 with a crucial 3-pointer from Davion Mitchell in the final minute securing the win. Tyler Herro led the Heat with 29 points, supported by Duncan Robinson's 20 points, as Miami shot an impressive 57%. Notably, in the last two games, the Heat have maintained a shooting accuracy of 58%, matching the team's seventh-best two-game span in history. Despite Pascal Siakam’s standout 36-point performance and Myles Turner and Tyrese Haliburton's contributions, the Pacers ultimately faltered after dominating early with three-point shooting, going from 12 of 15 to 9 of 24 from long range thereafter. The Pacers, who had a remarkable 28-point victory over Miami earlier in January, anticipated a tougher matchup this time, according to Coach Rick Carlisle. A pivotal 13-0 run by Miami helped swing the momentum, transforming a one-point deficit into a 12-point lead. Additionally, the game marked only the fifth time in Heat history that both teams had at least 68 points by halftime. With Andrew Wiggins absent due to injury and Jaime Jaquez Jr. leaving the game, the Heat showed resilience to overcome these setbacks. The Pacers will next face the Chicago Bulls, while the Heat will host the New York Knicks.

**Chicago Bulls 125 - 115 Toronto Raptors**  
In an exhilarating finish, the Chicago Bulls staged a thrilling comeback to defeat the Toronto Raptors 125-115 in overtime. Coby White emerged as the hero, scoring 24 points and executing a crucial four-point play with just four seconds left in regulation to tie the game at 110. During the overtime, Lonzo Ball's two pivotal 3-pointers sparked a decisive 10-2 run that secured the Bulls' victory. Despite a strong performance from Scottie Barnes, who scored 24 points for the Raptors, the team experienced their third consecutive loss, largely attributable to turnovers, which the Bulls capitalized on with 24 points. Immanuel Quickley contributed 23 points but fouled out early in overtime as the Raptors squandered their late lead. The absence of Nikola Vucevic was felt as the Bulls were outrebounded but still managed to clinch the game with critical plays when it mattered most.

Anunoby's clutch shot followed a series of lead changes in the final two minutes. Memphis had a chance to win, but Ja Morant's layup missed, and Santi Aldama's tip-in attempt was unsuccessful. Jalen Brunson paced the Knicks with 23 points and six assists, while Deuce McBride and Mikal Bridges contributed 17 and 15 points, respectively. For the Grizzlies, Morant scored 25 points, and Desmond Bane added 24, with Jaren Jackson Jr. contributing 18. A key factor in the Knicks' victory was capitalizing on Memphis's 19 turnovers, which resulted in 28 points. The win marked a stark contrast from their prior 37-point loss to Memphis on January 27. Knicks' center Mitchell Robinson made his season debut post ankle surgery, adding six points and five rebounds in over 12 minutes. The Knicks will face Miami next, while Memphis continues its homestand against San Antonio.

In a dominant performance, Bol Bol led the Phoenix Suns with 25 points, just one shy of his career high, as they snapped a three-game losing streak by defeating the New Orleans Pelicans 125-108. Despite missing key players like Zion Williamson, who had a triple-double in their previous victory, and CJ McCollum, the Pelicans couldn't keep up with the Suns, who never trailed in the game. Nick Richards contributed with 19 points and a game-high 12 rebounds, while Royce O'Neal added 18 points off the bench. Devin Booker and Kevin Durant each scored 17 points for the Suns.

The Utah Jazz edged out the Minnesota Timberwolves 117-116 with a dramatic game-winning dunk by Walker Kessler in the final seconds, snapping a six-game losing streak against Minnesota. John Collins was pivotal for the Jazz, scoring a season-high 29 points and grabbing 12 rebounds, while Isaiah Collier set a career-high with 14 assists.

The Jazz surged with a 27-4 run to start the third quarter, overturning an 11-point halftime deficit and taking control of the game. Though the Timberwolves briefly regained the lead late in the fourth quarter with Donte DiVincenzo's 3-pointer, Kessler’s dunk sealed the victory for Utah. Both teams played without key players for stretches, with the Jazz welcoming back John Collins and Collin Sexton after injuries. The Timberwolves will face Phoenix next, while the Jazz are set to host New Orleans.

**Los Angeles Lakers 106 - 102 LA Clippers**  
The Los Angeles Lakers secured their fifth consecutive victory, defeating the Minnesota Timberwolves 111-102, as they prepare to face the visiting Los Angeles Clippers on Friday. Luka Doncic, recently integrated into the Lakers' lineup, contributed 21 points and 13 rebounds, while LeBron James added 33 points and 17 rebounds, despite nursing a hamstring issue. Meanwhile, the Clippers, who are seeking better synergy since Kawhi Leonard's return, are 2-3 in a series of road games and are coming off a 122-117 win over the Chicago Bulls, with James Harden scoring 30 points, including a pivotal 3-pointer. The Clippers struggled to find a groove, evident from James Harden's erratic performance, shooting just 1 for 5 in the first half against the Bulls but rebounding with an explosive 20-point third quarter. Despite the Clippers' previous dominance in the rivalry with 11 straight wins, the Lakers have turned the tide, winning four out of the last six matchups. The Friday game will test Doncic's stamina, as he faces playing on consecutive nights, a challenge since his return from a calf injury. Additionally, Norman Powell's uncertain status due to left knee soreness adds to the Clippers' difficulties as they aim to improve their current 13-11 record since Leonard's return.
