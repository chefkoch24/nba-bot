**Oklahoma City Thunder 125 - 124 Houston Rockets**  
The Oklahoma City Thunder secured a thrilling 125-124 victory over the Houston Rockets in a rare double-overtime season opener, marked by a ring ceremony and a championship banner unveiling. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, last season's MVP and scoring champion, played a pivotal role by hitting two crucial free throws in the final moments after overcoming a quiet first half to score 35 points. Former Thunder star Kevin Durant, who joined the Rockets in the offseason, faced a hostile reception from the home crowd as he fouled out during the tense closing stages. Durant ended the game with 23 points and nine rebounds. The game featured impressive performances, including Chet Holmgren's 28 points for the Thunder and Alperen Sengun's career-high 39 points for the Rockets. A key moment occurred when Gilgeous-Alexander tied the game at the end of the fourth quarter, leading to an overtime battle that featured a controversial missed call on a timeout attempt by Durant. The Thunder's victory serves as a testament to their resilience as they embark on a new season.

**Los Angeles Lakers 109 - 119 Golden State Warriors**  
The Golden State Warriors managed to hold off the Los Angeles Lakers in a closely watched NBA Opening Night game despite the absence of LeBron James due to sciatica. The spotlight was on Stephen Curry, entering his 17th season, and Luka Doncic, playing his first full season for the Lakers after a trade. The Lakers, featuring new additions like Deandre Ayton and Marcus Smart, leaned on Doncic and Austin Reaves in the absence of James. Despite offseason injuries to key players like Jimmy Butler and younger talents such as Jonathan Kuminga and Brandin Podziemski, the Warriors aimed to reduce turnoversâ€”a persistent preseason issue. The Warriors' aging roster sees veteran Al Horford contributing limited minutes. Coach Steve Kerr remains optimistic about the team's focus and readiness.
