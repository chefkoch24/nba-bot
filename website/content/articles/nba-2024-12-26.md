**New York Knicks 117 - 114 San Antonio Spurs**  
In a thrilling Christmas matchup, the New York Knicks narrowly defeated the San Antonio Spurs 117-114, led by Mikal Bridges' impressive 41-point performance, his season-high. Despite Victor Wembanyama's extraordinary Christmas debut for the Spurs, where he scored 42 points and set a franchise record for holiday points along with grabbing 18 rebounds, the Knicks secured their fifth consecutive victory. Bridges was instrumental in closing out the game, hitting crucial jumpers in the final minutes to fend off the Spurs' comeback attempt. Karl-Anthony Towns and Jalen Brunson contributed significantly with 21 and 20 points, respectively, while Josh Hart's double-double and crucial rebounds in the closing seconds helped seal the Knicks' win. The Spurs, despite Wembanyama's historic performance, faltered by allowing 17 offensive rebounds, failing to capitalize on a chance to clinch a remarkable victory.

**Dallas Mavericks 99 - 105 Minnesota Timberwolves**  
The Minnesota Timberwolves secured a 105-99 victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Christmas Day, despite a late-game rally from Dallas that nearly erased a 28-point deficit. This matchup, a rematch of last season's Western Conference finals, took a dramatic turn when Mavericks' star Luka Doncic exited in the second quarter with a strained left calf, impacting Dallas's performance. While Doncic contributed 14 points before his departure, Kyrie Irving led the Mavericks with 39 points, narrowly missing a critical 3-pointer in the game's final moments. Anthony Edwards spearheaded the Timberwolves with 26 points, and Rudy Gobert added 14 points and 10 rebounds. Notably, Julius Randle, playing against his hometown team for the first time since a trade from the Knicks, delivered 23 points, 10 rebounds, and eight assists for Minnesota. Meanwhile, Klay Thompson of the Mavericks passed Reggie Miller for fifth place on the NBA's all-time 3-pointers made list.

In an intense matchup, the Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Boston Celtics 118-114, powered by Joel Embiid’s impressive 27-point performance and Tyrese Maxey’s standout 33 points and 12 assists. Embiid, who was nursing an ankle and sinus fracture, contributed crucial free throws in the final seconds, ensuring the Sixers held off Boston’s late comeback attempt. Maxey was especially clutch in the fourth quarter, delivering 13 points, including a pivotal layup that widened the lead. Boston’s Jayson Tatum put up a valiant effort with 32 points and 15 rebounds, while Jaylen Brown and Derrick White added 23 and 21 points, respectively.

**Phoenix Suns 110 - 100 Denver Nuggets**  
The Denver Nuggets delivered a commanding performance against the Phoenix Suns, securing a 117-90 victory on Monday night, highlighted by a dominant second half where they outscored the Suns 62-39. Nuggets coach Michael Malone praised his team's comprehensive effort but anticipates a more challenging contest in the upcoming Christmas night rematch in Phoenix. Despite the absence of star guard Jamal Murray, who was injured in the previous game against the New Orleans Pelicans, Nikola Jokic and Michael Porter Jr. propelled the Nuggets with 32 and 24 points, respectively. The Suns, missing key players Devin Booker and Grayson Allen, struggled offensively, shooting only 39.8 percent from the field, while Denver dominated the paint with a 50-24 advantage. Rookie guard Jalen Pickett made a notable impact off the bench, contributing 11 points and eight assists. The Suns have now lost three consecutive games and continue to grapple with injuries, as evidenced by their 1-9 record without Kevin Durant this season. With Booker and Allen ruled out again for the upcoming game, Phoenix seeks resilience in the face of adversity, as rookie Ryan Dunn emphasizes a "next-man-up" mentality amidst ongoing challenges.
