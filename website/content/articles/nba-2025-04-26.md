**Orlando Magic 95 - 93 Boston Celtics**  
Franz Wagner's 32 points and Paolo Banchero's 29 led the Orlando Magic to a thrilling 95-93 victory over the Boston Celtics, narrowing the Celtics' series lead to 2-1 in the Eastern Conference first-round playoffs. Boston's Jayson Tatum, returning from injury, scored 36 points but saw his team struggle with 3-point shooting, going 9 for 27, including a 17-minute stretch without a 3-pointer in the second half. Despite their impressive road record, the defending champions are now 0-3 in Orlando this season. The game was intensely physical, featuring 43 fouls, a flagrant foul on Cole Anthony, and 35 total turnovers, 21 by the Celtics. Tensions were high with Jaylen Brown dislocating a finger and hinting at potential altercations in Game 4. Although the Celtics pulled ahead early, a 14-0 run led by Wagner and Banchero helped the Magic secure a lead they maintained through a nail-biting finish.

In a thrilling Game 3 of their first-round playoff series, the Milwaukee Bucks secured a 117-101 victory over the Indiana Pacers, cutting the Pacers' series lead to 2-1.

Notably, Bucks star Damian Lillard struggled, scoring only seven points. Indiana's Pascal Siakam led his team with 28 points, but it wasnâ€™t enough to fend off Milwaukee, who will host Game 4.
