**Dallas Cowboys 20 - 27 Cincinnati Bengals**  
In a dramatic Monday night matchup, the Cincinnati Bengals secured a 27-20 victory over the Dallas Cowboys, thanks to a decisive late-game play by quarterback Joe Burrow and receiver Ja'Marr Chase. The game turned when a blocked punt by Nick Vigil was mishandled by Cowboys player Amani Oruwariye, giving the Bengals possession with just under two minutes remaining. Burrow capitalized by connecting with Chase for a 40-yard touchdown, breaking a tie and ending Cincinnati's three-game losing streak. Chase, the NFL leader in receiving yards and touchdowns, had a standout performance with 177 yards on 14 catches. The Cowboysâ€™ miscue evoked memories of their infamous 1993 Thanksgiving Day error, further compounded by the loss of linebacker DeMarvion Overshown to a knee injury. As Dallas' playoff hopes dwindle, Burrow's fourth consecutive 300-yard passing game marks a bright spot in an otherwise challenging season for the Bengals.
