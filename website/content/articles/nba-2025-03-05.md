**Phoenix Suns 119 - 117 LA Clippers**  
In a matchup of two struggling teams, the Phoenix Suns and Los Angeles Clippers faced off, with both squads looking to end season skids. The Suns, who had lost 11 of their last 14 games, were desperate to close their four-game gap from the Western Conference play-in spot, while the Clippers, having lost five of their last six games, aimed to solidify their position in the top six for a guaranteed playoff berth. Despite Kevin Durant's frustration over Phoenix's performance, particularly their 22 turnovers leading to 40 points for the Minnesota Timberwolves, both he and Devin Booker would need to lead a turnaround for their team. The Clippers were dealing with their own issues, including Norman Powell's absence due to injury, while Kawhi Leonard shone with season-highs of 33 points and 10 rebounds in a recent loss to the Lakers.
