Despite missing Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton, the Milwaukee Bucks managed to defeat the Orlando Magic 117-99, thanks to Bobby Portis' impressive performance of 30 points, nine rebounds, and five steals.

**Denver Nuggets 116 - 107 Minnesota Timberwolves**  
The Minnesota Timberwolves and Denver Nuggets are set to face off in a crucial showdown as they vie for first place in the Western Conference with three games remaining in the regular season. Despite the Nuggets having won the previous playoff matchup in 2023, the Timberwolves, led by Anthony Edwards who scored a career-high 51 points in their previous game, have emerged as top contenders this season. Both teams have won four of their last five games, setting the stage for an intense battle between two Northwest Division rivals. Nikola Jokic, a frontrunner for league MVP, will lead the Nuggets against Edwards and the Timberwolves in a high-stakes game reminiscent of their playoff matchup in 2018.

**LA Clippers 108 - 124 Phoenix Suns**  
The Phoenix Suns aim to bounce back from a sluggish start in their previous game against the undermanned Los Angeles Clippers, where they scored only 10 points in the first quarter and 33 in the first half. The Clippers were missing key players like Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, and James Harden. Russell Westbrook stood out with an impressive performance, becoming the first Clippers player with at least 15 points, 15 rebounds, and 15 assists in a game. Despite a late rally by the Suns, they fell short as they dropped to the No. 7 spot in the Western Conference standings. Head coach Frank Vogel emphasized the need for better execution and toughness on both ends of the court following the disappointing loss.
