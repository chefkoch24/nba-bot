**Charlotte Hornets 104 - 110 Philadelphia 76ers**  
In an exciting matchup, the Philadelphia 76ers secured their first consecutive wins of the season with a 110-104 victory over the Charlotte Hornets. Paul George was in fine form, scoring 29 points, while Tyrese Maxey contributed eight crucial points in the final 30 seconds to turn the game in Philadelphia's favor. Despite the loss, Charlotte's Brandon Miller shone with 34 points, hitting seven 3-pointers in the second half, and Nick Richards impressed with 22 points and 14 rebounds. The 76ers, improving with a third win in five games, benefitted from better ball movement resulting in open shots. Charlotte's rookie Tidjane Salaun recorded his first double-double, and K.J. Simpson added significant contributions. Notably, Mark Williams returned for the Hornets after nearly a year, and though appearing rusty, featured in his first game since December 2023. The 76ers will next face the Magic, while the Hornets will play the Knicks.

The Bucks were on fire offensively, maintaining a shooting accuracy of over 70% in the first half. Meanwhile, the Pistons, with Cade Cunningham's 23 points leading their effort, couldn't capitalize on the opportunity to continue in the tournament, as Milwaukee seized control early and never relented. The Bucks next host Atlanta, while the Pistons travel to Boston.

**New York Knicks 121 - 106 Orlando Magic**  
The New York Knicks secured a 121-106 victory over the Orlando Magic, clinching the top spot in East Group A and advancing to the NBA Cup quarterfinals, where they will face Atlanta on December 11. Karl-Anthony Towns led the Knicks with 23 points and 15 rebounds, while Jalen Brunson added 21 points in the win.

Despite Franz Wagner's 30 points and Moritz Wagner's 20 off the bench, the Magic's six-game winning streak came to an end. However, Orlando still advanced as the East wild card and will visit Milwaukee next. This game marked Orlando's conclusion of their successful Big Apple stint, having previously defeated Brooklyn twice, and maintained their ongoing record of making at least one 3-pointer in 1,398 consecutive games, the fifth-longest streak in NBA history.

**Toronto Raptors 122 - 111 Indiana Pacers**  
In a dominant performance, the Toronto Raptors triumphed over the Indiana Pacers with a 122-111 victory, largely fueled by Scottie Barnes' career-high 35 points and RJ Barrett's 29 points. The Raptors set the pace early, maintaining a lead that peaked at 24 points in the third quarter, despite the Pacers' efforts, including Tyrese Haliburton's 30 points. Barnes, who also contributed nine assists and six rebounds, surpassed his previous scoring high of 32 points. Toronto capitalized on Indiana's 21 turnovers, turning them into 23 points. While Jakob Poeltl recorded a double-double with 17 points and 10 rebounds, Ochai Agbaji's perfect shooting from beyond the arc was crucial in widening the gap in the fourth quarter. The win extended Indiana's road losing streak to seven and marked another disappointing NBA Cup group play performance for the Pacers, who had reached the championship game last year. Toronto continued their strong home record, improving to 6-4, although they struggled away with a 1-11 road record.

**Oklahoma City Thunder 133 - 106 Utah Jazz**  
The Oklahoma City Thunder secured their place in the NBA Cup quarterfinals with a decisive 133-106 victory over the Utah Jazz, highlighting standout performances by Jalen Williams with 28 points and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander with 26 points, seven assists, and six rebounds. Oklahoma City concluded their West Group B play at 3-1, clinching the group after Phoenix defeated San Antonio. Gilgeous-Alexander, who was recognized as the Western Conference player of the month, scored 15 points in the second half, helping extend their lead to as much as 30 points. Key contributions came from Isaiah Joe, who netted 19 points, and Aaron Wiggins, who added 16. The Jazz struggled with 29 turnovers, 19 of which occurred in the first half. Despite a strong start and leading 19-10, Utah couldn't maintain momentum, largely due to their turnover woes, as they dropped to 4-17 for the season. Collin Sexton led Utah with 17 points, while Walker Kessler and John Collins added 15 each. The Thunder will visit Toronto next, while the Jazz face Portland.

**Dallas Mavericks 121 - 116 Memphis Grizzlies**  
In a highly anticipated NBA Cup matchup, the Memphis Grizzlies, with Marcus Smart energizing their bench, are set to face the surging Dallas Mavericks. Smart, adapting to a new role as a reserve after illness, brought intensity and performance in Memphis's recent wins, highlighted by his 25-point effort against Detroit. His influence has been a key factor in the Grizzlies' six-game win streak, with the team edging opponents by at least 11 points since his return. Smart's off-the-bench presence has allowed Memphis to start rookie Jaylen Wells, bolstering their defensive length. The Grizzlies appreciate Smart's veteran leadership, as highlighted by Ja Morant, who praised his adaptability. Meanwhile, Dallas rides its momentum with Luka Doncic back from a wrist sprain, scoring 36 points in their latest victory over Portland, marking their eighth win in nine games. Doncic leads the Mavericks, supplemented by Kyrie Irving and Quentin Grimes's recent performances, making this game a clash between in-form teams aiming to extend their success.

**Phoenix Suns 104 - 93 San Antonio Spurs**  
In an eventful game, the Phoenix Suns defeated the San Antonio Spurs 104-93, despite losing Kevin Durant to an ankle injury midway through the second quarter. Devin Booker led the team with 29 points and surpassed 15,000 career points, making him second only to Walter Davis on Phoenix’s all-time scoring list. The Suns rallied from Durant's absence with balanced contributions, including 16 points each from Stephon Castle and Tyus Jones. For the Spurs, Victor Wembanyama showed resilience, scoring all his 15 points in the second half after missing his initial seven shots. Devin Vassell was San Antonio’s top performer with 25 points off the bench. Meanwhile, Jeremy Sochan made a noteworthy return for the Spurs, adding 14 points and 12 rebounds after recovering from thumb surgery. Despite the Suns' victory, their hopes for a wild-card berth in the NBA Cup were dashed, as Dallas' win eliminated them from advancing to the quarterfinals.

**Denver Nuggets 119 - 115 Golden State Warriors**  
In a matchup set for Tuesday night, the Golden State Warriors, having already secured a spot in the NBA Cup quarterfinals despite a recent four-game losing streak, look to sweep their in-season tournament group against the Denver Nuggets. The Warriors started strong, winning 12 of their first 15 games, but seek to regain their momentum in West Group C, where they currently stand 3-0. Meanwhile, the Nuggets, with a shaky 1-2 record in the group, have struggled with consistency, notably faltering with free throws in a recent loss against the Los Angeles Clippers. Star forward Aaron Gordon returned to the lineup after a ten-game absence due to a calf strain, but Michael Porter Jr.'s free-throw struggles, despite his improved scoring average of 18.6 points per game, hindered the team's efforts. Coach Steve Kerr of the Warriors plans to adjust his rotation to break the team's slump while keeping Stephen Curry fresh, highlighting the depth and experience of Golden State's roster as they aim to maintain their championship pedigree.

**Sacramento Kings 120 - 111 Houston Rockets**  
The Houston Rockets are poised to clinch the top seed in the Western Conference quarterfinals of the NBA Cup with a potential win against the Sacramento Kings, having previously defeated the Clippers, Trail Blazers, and Timberwolves. Their recent victory, a 117-111 overtime against the Timberwolves, marks the start of their current three-game triumph streak, which includes further intense wins against the 76ers and Thunder. Alperen Sengun, honored as the Western Conference Player of the Week for his outstanding performances, attributes much of the team's success to Fred VanVleet's 38-point contribution against the Thunder and Dillon Brooks' defensive prowess. As the Kings continue to struggle, dropping three out of their last four games, notably falling to the Spurs after a lineup change by coach Mike Brown, they face an uphill battle against the surging Rockets who previously swept the Kings last season.

**LA Clippers 127 - 105 Portland Trail Blazers**  
The Los Angeles Clippers continued their strong home form with a thrilling 126-122 victory over the Denver Nuggets, setting the stage for their crucial NBA Cup group finale against the Portland Trail Blazers. Despite both teams facing elimination with a loss, the Clippers gained confidence from a strong performance by James Harden, who nearly secured a triple-double with 39 points, 11 assists, and nine rebounds, while also reaching a milestone as the second player in NBA history to make 3,000 three-pointers. Harden's shooting has improved recently, something Coach Tyronn Lue noted positively. Norman Powell's return from injury was impactful as he added 28 points to maintain his team-high average of 23.6 points per game. The struggling Trail Blazers, who recently lost to the Dallas Mavericks despite shooting 58.1 percent from beyond the arc, rely on Anfernee Simons and Shaedon Sharpe, with Simons notably scoring 24 points in a single quarter against Dallas. However, their road troubles persist, having lost six of their last seven away games.
