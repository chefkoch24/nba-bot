**Detroit Pistons 101 - 114 New Orleans Pelicans**  
Zion Williamson scored 36 points as the New Orleans Pelicans defeated the short-handed Detroit Pistons 114-101. Williamson shot an impressive 13 for 14 from the floor and 10 for 14 from the line, becoming only the third player in the last 20 years to score 35 points without a 3-pointer and fewer than 15 field goal attempts. The Pistons played without four of their five starters, and despite the efforts of Chimezu Metu and Malachi Flynn, they lost their sixth straight game. The Pelicans, now 44-27, have won five of their last six games. The Pistons will need four wins in their final 11 games to avoid exceeding the franchise record of 66 losses.

**LA Clippers 107 - 121 Philadelphia 76ers**  
In a highly anticipated matchup, Tobias Harris led the Philadelphia 76ers to a 121-107 victory over James Harden and the Los Angeles Clippers, marking the first meeting between the two teams since the trade.

Kawhi Leonard and Paul George scored 20 and 18 points, respectively, for the Clippers, who have struggled recently. Harden, who forced his way out of Philadelphia last November, has been performing well with the Clippers, averaging 17.3 points and 8.5 assists. The Sixers' outside shooting and strong fourth quarter helped secure the win, as they hit 18 3-pointers. Philadelphia will next play Sacramento on Monday, while the Clippers will host Indiana.

**Miami Heat 121 - 84 Cleveland Cavaliers**  
The Miami Heat built their biggest lead in more than a decade, dominating the Cleveland Cavaliers with a final score of 121-84. Miami's reserves scored 59 points, Haywood Highsmith had 18, and Bam Adebayo recorded a double-double with 15 points and 16 rebounds. The Heat's 45-point cushion was their largest lead in years and helped them snap a three-game home slide. Cleveland struggled, with only one player reaching double figures and losing for the seventh time in 10 games. Miami's dominant performance was a much-needed response after a 23-point loss to New Orleans on Friday, and they remain seventh in the Eastern Conference standings.

**Los Angeles Lakers 150 - 145 Indiana Pacers**  
In a high-scoring thriller, the Los Angeles Lakers held off a late Pacers comeback to secure a 150-145 victory, their highest-scoring performance in 37 years.
