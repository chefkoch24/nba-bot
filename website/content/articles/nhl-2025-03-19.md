**Montreal Canadiens 6 - 3 Ottawa Senators**  
The Montreal Canadiens snapped the Ottawa Senators' six-game winning streak with a thrilling 6-3 victory, highlighted by Nick Suzuki's crucial power-play goal in the third period. The Canadiens erupted with five goals in the final period, tying the game twice before Suzuki found the net, aided by Brendan Gallagher's assist, who not only freed up the puck from Senators goalie Linus Ullmark but also contributed a goal and two assists. Josh Anderson added another dimension to the Canadiens' offense with a pair of goals, including an empty-netter that sealed the win. Christian Dvorak was instrumental with a goal and three assists, helping Montreal leap ahead into the second Eastern Conference wild card playoff spot. Additionally, Suzuki became the first Montreal player since Mark Recchi to notch 70 points in consecutive seasons, while Senators forward Brady Tkachuk saw his nine-game point streak halted. The dramatic third period's five-goal feat marked the Canadiens' best since their 2021 win against the Pittsburgh Penguins.

**New York Rangers 1 - 2 Calgary Flames**  
The Calgary Flames ended a three-game losing streak with a 2-1 victory over the New York Rangers at Madison Square Garden, thanks to key performances from Nazem Kadri, who scored a goal and provided an assist, and Matt Coronato, who netted the winning goal. MacKenzie Weegar also contributed two assists, while Dan Vladar recorded 12 saves. Despite an early 1-0 lead from Artemi Panarin, who extended his point streak to 10 games, the Rangers failed to maintain momentum, managing only three shots in the second period, and were outpaced by the Flames. Calgary moved closer to a playoff spot in the Western Conference, trailing the St. Louis Blues by two points with two games in hand. On the Rangers' side, Igor Shesterkin's 33 saves weren't enough to prevent their second consecutive home loss, a result that pushed them further from playoff contention in the East, now behind the Montreal Canadiens who have games in hand.

Despite efforts from Nikojal Ehlers and Alex Iafallo to keep the Jets competitive, including Ehlers' goal to tie the game 1-1 in the first period, Vancouver's offense proved too potent with Boeser netting his 20th of the season and Suter sealing the score with an empty-netter.
