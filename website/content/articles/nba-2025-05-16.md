**Denver Nuggets 119 - 107 Oklahoma City Thunder**  
In a thrilling Game 6, the Denver Nuggets defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder 119-107 to force a decisive Game 7 in their playoff series. Jamal Murray, battling illness, scored 25 points, while Nikola Jokic contributed 29 points, 14 rebounds, and eight assists. A standout performance came from Julian Strawther, who scored a career playoff-high 15 points in the second half, helping Denver secure a comfortable lead. Despite Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's 32-point performance, the Thunder couldn't muster enough support to clinch the series. The Nuggets also overcame a 12-point deficit late in the first half with crucial contributions from Christian Braun, who tallied a playoff career-high of 23 points and 12 rebounds. Denver now awaits a final showdown in Oklahoma City on Sunday, with the victorious team set to face the Minnesota Timberwolves. Notably, Aaron Gordon appeared to suffer a hamstring injury late in the game, and the Thunder have rarely lost consecutive games this season.
