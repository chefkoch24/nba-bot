**Charlotte Hornets 125 - 132 Golden State Warriors**  
In an exciting showdown at the Spectrum Center in Charlotte, Stephen Curry scored 26 points in his annual homecoming, leading the Golden State Warriors to a 132-125 victory over the Charlotte Hornets before a record-setting crowd of 19,685. The Warriors showcased their shooting prowess, going 24 of 49 from beyond the arc, with Brandon Podziemski contributing 19 points, including five 3-pointers, and a remarkable leaning 3-pointer to beat the shot clock. Despite 33 points from Brandon Miller and 27 points from LaMelo Ball, including 7 of 10 from 3-point range, the Hornets couldn't maintain their momentum after briefly taking the lead. The Warriors regained control with Podziemski's early fourth-quarter threes and solidified their win with clutch plays by Draymond Green and Jimmy Butler, who sealed the game with free throws. Charlotte struggled with key injuries to starters Miles Bridges and Ryan Kalkbrenner, and despite outscoring the Warriors 56-32 in the paint, they fell short as they prepare to visit the Bucks, while the Warriors get set to host the Thunder.
