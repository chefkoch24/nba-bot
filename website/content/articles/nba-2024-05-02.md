**Boston Celtics 118 - 84 Miami Heat**  
The Boston Celtics advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals by defeating the short-handed Miami Heat 118-84 in Game 5, led by Jaylen Brown and Derrick White each scoring 25 points. The Celtics sought revenge for their previous playoff defeat to Miami, with Brown noting a business-like approach to secure the win. Despite missing center Kristaps Porzingis, Boston dominated the Heat who were plagued by injuries throughout the series. Miami struggled from long-range, going 3 of 29 on 3-point attempts. Bam Adebayo and Tyler Herro led the Heat in scoring, but it wasn't enough as Boston's lead reached as high as 37 points. The Celtics will face the winner of the Cleveland-Orlando series in the next round, as they look to continue their playoff redemption.

**LA Clippers 93 - 123 Dallas Mavericks**  
With Kawhi Leonard out due to knee inflammation, the Los Angeles Clippers secured a crucial Game 4 win against the Dallas Mavericks behind a strong performance from James Harden. Harden scored 33 points and led the Clippers to victory after building a 31-point lead early in the game. Despite Luka Doncic playing through a right knee sprain and the Mavericks facing early deficits in both losses, Kyrie Irving's valiant efforts were not enough to overcome the Clippers. With Leonard ruled out for Game 5, the Mavericks will have to find a way to contain the Clippers' outside shooting and dominant performances from Harden and Paul George to stay alive in the series.
