**LA Clippers 100 - 118 Minnesota Timberwolves**  
In a surprising turn of events, the Minnesota Timberwolves came back from a 22-point deficit to defeat the Los Angeles Clippers 118-100, led by Anthony Edwards' 37 points and Nickeil Alexander-Walker's season-high 28 points. Kawhi Leonard left the game with back spasms, adding to the Clippers' struggles. Despite missing Karl-Anthony Towns, the Timberwolves rallied behind Mike Conley's 23 points and Rudy Gobert's defensive efforts. This win marked the Wolves' largest comeback since 2012, and they improved to 2-2 on their road trip. The Clippers, on the other hand, lost their second straight game for only the second time since Christmas. Leonard's status remains uncertain as the Timberwolves are set to face Utah next, while the Clippers will travel to Chicago.
