**Tampa Bay Lightning 3 - 4 Toronto Maple Leafs**  
In an electrifying matchup at Amalie Arena, Matthew Knies secured a hat trick, including the game-winning overtime goal, to lead the Toronto Maple Leafs to a 4-3 win over the Tampa Bay Lightning. Assisted by Auston Matthews, Knies clinched victory by converting a backdoor pass into an open net. This win extended Toronto's Atlantic Division lead over Tampa Bay to three points and marked an impressive performance after losing to the Florida Panthers just the previous night. Knies, noted for his growing confidence and potential, shone brightly alongside Mitch Marner, who contributed a goal and two assists, and Matthews, who added three assists. Despite a slow start, the Lightning fought back with goals from Oliver Bjorkstrand and Victor Hedman, who tied the game and forced it into overtime. Each team's goalie made crucial saves in the extra period, underscoring the tense and competitive nature of the match.

**New York Rangers 5 - 8 Philadelphia Flyers**  
The Philadelphia Flyers triumphed over the New York Rangers 8-5 at Madison Square Garden in a thrilling game marked by nine third-period goals and Tyson Foerster's first NHL hat trick. Foerster's two goals in the final period contributed to his 22 for the season, and he impressed with six goals in his last five games. Supporting him, Flyers Travis Sanheim, Jakob Pelletier, Sean Couturier, and Owen Tippett also found the net in the third. Mika Zibanejad shined for the Rangers with four assists, but it wasn’t enough as the team suffered its third consecutive defeat, jeopardizing their playoff hopes. The game took an unexpected turn with high-scoring antics and Flyers’ achievement of scoring six goals in a period for the first time since 1993. Meanwhile, Vincent Trocheck's short-handed goal was his fourth of the season, a career high. The Rangers, now eight points behind the Montreal Canadiens, face elimination unless they secure a win against the New York Islanders.

**Minnesota Wild 8 - 7 San Jose Sharks**  
In an action-packed game in St. Paul, Minnesota Wild's Kirill Kaprizov scored twice in his return from a 28-game absence, including the game-winner at 1:01 into overtime, to secure an 8-7 victory over the San Jose Sharks. Kaprizov combined with Mats Zuccarello for the decisive goal, capping a dramatic comeback win. Joel Eriksson Ek, also fresh off the injury list, had an impressive four-goal performance for the Wild, bolstered by Matt Boldy's four assists. Marc-Andre Fleury, nearing retirement, made 24 saves in what was likely his final regular-season home start, ensuring Minnesota clinched the first wild-card spot into the Stanley Cup Playoffs from the Western Conference. For the Sharks, rookie Macklin Celebrini notched his first NHL hat trick and added two assists, but despite a spirited comeback that tied the game in the third, the team suffered its seventh consecutive loss. The game also led to the playoff elimination of the Vancouver Canucks and Utah Hockey Club. Notable was the absence of Sharks defenseman Mario Ferraro post a blocked shot, and Eriksson Ek's and Celebrini's hat tricks marking the season's second set of dueling three-goal performances.

**Anaheim Ducks 4 - 3 Calgary Flames**  
The Anaheim Ducks edged the Calgary Flames 4-3 in overtime at Honda Center, with Cutter Gauthier netting his second goal of the game just over a minute into the extra period. Gauthier, who has back-to-back two-goal performances, secured the victory by receiving a drop pass from Leo Carlsson and scoring with a wrist shot from the slot. The Ducks had a dramatic third period comeback with Frank Vatrano and Gauthier scoring only eight seconds apart to force overtime. Goalie Ville Husso contributed significantly with 36 saves, aiding the Ducks to bounce back after losing two of their last three games. Calgary’s performance included standout plays from Mikael Backlund, who had a goal and an assist, and Dustin Wolf, who made 18 saves. Despite leading 3-1 late in the game thanks to goals from Yegor Sharangovich and Matt Coronato, the Flames could not maintain their lead, leaving them five points shy of a wild card spot for the Stanley Cup Playoffs.
