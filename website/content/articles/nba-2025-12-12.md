**Houston Rockets 115 - 113 LA Clippers**  
In a thrilling finish, the Houston Rockets narrowly defeated the Los Angeles Clippers 115-113, thanks to Amen Thompson's decisive three-point play with 17.2 seconds left. Thompson's pivotal putback and subsequent free throw broke a 110-110 tie, capitalizing on Houston's dominant rebounding night, with the team snagging 21 offensive boards and outrebounding the Clippers 51-28. Amen Thompson was instrumental throughout, contributing 20 points, nine rebounds, and eight assists. Alperen Sengun also shined for Houston with 22 points, 15 rebounds, five assists, and four steals. Despite impressive performances from the Clippers' Ivica Zubac, who tied a season-high with 33 points, and Kawhi Leonard, who added 24 points, crucial late-game errors, including an offensive foul and a violation on an inbounds pass, cost Los Angeles the game.

**Milwaukee Bucks 116 - 101 Boston Celtics**  
In a thrilling game, Kyle Kuzma's season-best 31 points led the Milwaukee Bucks to a 116-101 victory over the Boston Celtics, even in the absence of star player Giannis Antetokounmpo. Bobby Portis was instrumental, contributing 27 points and 10 rebounds, and his clutch 3-pointers helped the Bucks overturn a halftime deficit into a commanding lead by the fourth quarter. Despite Jaylen Brown's 30-point effort and Jordan Walsh's 20 points, the Celtics' reliance on long-range shots faltered, hitting just 28.6% from beyond the arc. Kevin Porter Jr. added a triple-double performance for Milwaukee, which improved to 2-7 without Antetokounmpo, who faces a 2-4 week recovery from a calf strain. The win also halted Boston's five-game winning streak, while Milwaukee now prepares to face the Brooklyn Nets. Meanwhile, Boston will host the Detroit Pistons in their next matchup.

**New Orleans Pelicans 143 - 120 Portland Trail Blazers**  
In the game where New Orleans Pelicans secured a 143-120 victory over the depleted Portland Trail Blazers, Jordan Poole shined with 22 points after returning from an 18-game absence due to a quadriceps injury. Trey Murphy III added 24 points, while Bryce McGowens matched his career high with 23 points, contributing to New Orleans snapping a seven-game losing streak. Under their new coach James Borrego, following the departure of Willie Green, this win marks only their second victory.

For Portland, dealing with a limited roster, Shaedon Sharpe led with 21 points as they suffered their sixth loss in seven games. Herb Jones received the first ejection of his career after disputing a call late in the first half, which temporarily closed the score gap, but the Pelicans maintained their momentum into the second half.

**Sacramento Kings 105 - 136 Denver Nuggets**  
In a tightly contested NBA matchup, the Denver Nuggets defeated the Sacramento Kings, with Nikola Jokic leading the way by scoring 36 points and grabbing 12 rebounds. This marked the fourth meeting between these two teams in under six weeks, spurred by schedule changes following both teams' early exits from the NBA Cup. Denver, who tied for second in West Group C, has beaten Sacramento in two out of three prior matchups this season. Though Russell Westbrook did not achieve a triple-double in their previous encounters, the Kings' veteran star recently posted his fourth of the season against Indiana. Despite ongoing injuries to Aaron Gordon and Christian Braun, Denver has seen success, averaging 127.4 points over their last eight games with contributions from new starters Peyton Watson and Spencer Jones. Jokic nearly added another triple-double to his impressive season tally, while Russell Westbrook, who has made a significant impact since his move to Sacramento, continues to improve his stats compared to last season with Denver.
