**Buffalo Sabres 4 - 1 Boston Bruins**  
The Boston Bruins ended their four-game losing streak with a decisive 4-1 victory over the Buffalo Sabres, highlighted by Charlie Coyle's two power-play goals. Brad Marchand and Jake DeBrusk each contributed two assists, while goalie Jeremy Swayman made 26 saves to fortify the Bruins' win. The Sabres, stumbling with four losses in their last five games, struggled particularly with special teams, allowing three power-play goals while failing to capitalize on six power-play opportunities themselves. Erik Johnson scored Buffalo’s sole goal, and Devon Levi made 21 saves. The Sabres have now allowed the most first-period goals in the NHL this season, an issue noted by head coach Don Granato. The Bruins' victory marked their successful return from a short break, with Coyle and Mason Lohrei scoring early to establish a lead that Morgan Geekie extended further. Buffalo’s captain, Tage Thompson, was absent for personal reasons, and forward Alex Tuch acknowledged the team's current lack of confidence and cohesion.

**Toronto Maple Leafs 7 - 5 Ottawa Senators**  
The Ottawa Senators overcame a slow start to secure a 4-2 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs, with Drake Batherson leading the charge by scoring twice. Despite Toronto's early 2-0 lead, the Senators rallied impressively, aided by standout goaltending from Joonas Korpisalo, who made crucial saves and kept the game tied with a remarkable stop on John Tavares’ breakaway late in the second period. Parker Kelly's short-handed goal and Batherson's opportunistic bank shot from below the goal line were pivotal in shifting the game's momentum in favor of Ottawa. Brady Tkachuk capped the comeback with an empty-net goal, marking his 300th NHL point. Despite strong starts from Matthew Knies and Tyler Bertuzzi for Toronto, the Maple Leafs' power play faltered, failing to convert on three opportunities, while William Nylander extended his impressive point streak to 12 games.

**St Louis Blues 3 - 2 Nashville Predators**  
The St. Louis Blues defeated the Nashville Predators 7-4 at the Enterprise Center, with a potent first-period performance where they scored a season-high four goals. Robert Thomas was instrumental for the Blues with two goals, while Cam Fowler, a recent acquisition from the Anaheim Ducks, recorded a goal and two assists, marking his first multi-point game since early 2024 and scoring his first goal as a Blue. Jordan Kyrou contributed with a goal and an assist, and Joel Hofer made 26 saves. Despite Steven Stamkos and Jonathan Marchessault each netting a goal and an assist for Nashville, the Predators were unable to recover after Juuse Saros allowed five goals on 15 shots, leading to his substitution. The Blues' consistent offensive pressure, highlighted by Philip Broberg's goal, ultimately overwhelmed Nashville's defense, despite the Predators managing to repeatedly cut the deficit to one goal. Marchessault extended his goal streak to five games and his point streak to eight, underscoring a fierce but ultimately futile comeback effort for Nashville.
