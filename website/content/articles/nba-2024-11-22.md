**Charlotte Hornets 123 - 121 Detroit Pistons**  
In a thrilling overtime victory, the Charlotte Hornets edged out the Detroit Pistons 123-121, led by Brandon Miller's stunning career-high 38 points, including eight in overtime. Miller showcased exceptional three-point shooting, going 8 for 12 from beyond the arc, with two crucial threes in the extra period. LaMelo Ball also delivered a stellar performance with 35 points and nine assists before fouling out just one second into overtime. The game was a rollercoaster as Charlotte surrendered a 20-point lead in the third quarter, with Detroit's Cade Cunningham tallying 27 points and 10 assists before exiting late due to a hip injury. Despite challenges with foul trouble, Ball's 13-point burst in the third quarter was pivotal. Notably, Miller and Ball's performances marked the first time two Hornets scored 35 points in the same game. Meanwhile, Charlotte's centers were absent due to injuries, while Jalen Duren of the Pistons struggled, contributing only five points. The Pistons will next face the Orlando Magic, and the Hornets are set to play the Milwaukee Bucks.

**Toronto Raptors 110 - 105 Minnesota Timberwolves**  
RJ Barrett shone with 31 points, while Scottie Barnes, returning from an injury and wearing protective glasses, added 17 points and six assists to help the Toronto Raptors clinch a 110-105 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves. The win marked Toronto's first consecutive wins of the season and extended their home winning streak against Minnesota to 20 games, a run unbroken since 2004. Chris Boucher contributed 22 points, and Jakob Poeltl recorded his fourth straight double-double with 15 points and 12 rebounds. For the Timberwolves, Anthony Edwards, who scored 21 of his 26 points in the second half, and Julius Randle with 23 points, led the scoring. Despite these efforts, Minnesota's drought in Toronto continued, further highlighting their difficulties, barring a neutral ground win during the pandemic in Tampa in 2021. The Raptors capitalized on a late 13-1 run to secure the win, with Chris Boucher sparking the momentum and Barrett concluding it with a spectacular alley-oop dunk.

**San Antonio Spurs 126 - 118 Utah Jazz**  
The San Antonio Spurs secured a 126-118 victory over the Utah Jazz, powered by Harrison Barnes' impressive 25 points and 10 rebounds, alongside rookie Stephon Castle's 18-point contribution. Despite missing key players Victor Wembanyama and Devin Vassell due to minor knee injuries, the Spurs achieved their second consecutive win. San Antonio's comeback was sparked by Charles Bassey's strong defensive performance, including a career-high six blocks. The Spurs overcame an 18-point deficit in the second half, outscoring the Jazz 34-22 in the third quarter and maintaining their momentum into the fourth for a decisive 41-29 scoring edge. Lauri Markkanen led Utah with 27 points, but their fourth consecutive loss was exacerbated by 11 second-half turnovers. Notably, San Antonio (8-8) surpassed last season's slow start, having not reached their eighth win until late January. The Spurs and Jazz wrap up their respective homestands on Saturday, facing Golden State and New York.
