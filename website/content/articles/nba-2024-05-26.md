**Indiana Pacers 111 - 114 Boston Celtics**  
In a thrilling comeback, the Boston Celtics beat the Indiana Pacers 114-111 to take a 3-0 lead in the Eastern Conference finals. Jrue Holiday, overcoming illness, made a crucial three-point play and game-saving steal, while Jayson Tatum had a playoff career-high 36 points. Missing All-NBA guard Tyrese Haliburton, the Pacers couldn't hold off the Celtics' sixth straight playoff win. Boston rallied from an 18-point deficit, with Holiday's heroics sealing the victory, as they look to secure their second NBA Finals trip in three seasons with a Game 4 win.
