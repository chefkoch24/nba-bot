**Chicago Bulls 90 - 109 Miami Heat**  
The Chicago Bulls, despite having home-court advantage due to a better overall record, entered their Eastern Conference play-in game as potential underdogs against the Miami Heat, testing their depth with several key point guards injured. Lonzo Ball remained doubtful to play, with Josh Giddey managing a hand injury yet boasting impressive performances against Miami, averaging a triple-double in prior encounters. While the Bulls seemed strong following a winning streak, the Heat's momentum had recently faltered, losing four of their last six games. Notably, Miami's Jaime Jaquez Jr. recorded a career-high 41 points in a narrow loss to Washington, and Tyler Herro, alongside Bam Adebayo, both key players for the Heat, remained integral components all season. Herro and Adebayo were consistent headliners in the season series against Chicago, underscoring their significance for Miami as they prepared to meet the Atlanta Hawks next in the playoffs.

**Sacramento Kings 106 - 120 Dallas Mavericks**  
The Dallas Mavericks, who struggled throughout the second half of the season, secured the final play-in spot in the Western Conference despite trading their star player, Luka Doncic, to the Los Angeles Lakers. Facing significant adversity, including the loss of standout guard Kyrie Irving to a season-ending injury, Dallas managed to clinch the No. 10 seed with a 39-43 record. Their do-or-die matchup is against the Sacramento Kings, who swept their regular-season series and boast a strong lineup featuring Domantas Sabonis, DeMar DeRozan, and Zach LaVine. The Kings, with a 40-42 record, have shown recent momentum, winning four of their last six games under interim coach Doug Christie. With Sacramento's Jonas Valanciunas having extensive play-in experience, both teams face an intense battle for survival, with the winner advancing to face the loser of the Golden State Warriors and Memphis Grizzlies game for a playoff berth. Veteran Klay Thompson, now with Dallas, aims to redeem himself after a poor previous performance against the Kings while representing the Warriors.
