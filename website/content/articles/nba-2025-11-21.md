**Orlando Magic 129 - 101 LA Clippers**  
The Orlando Magic continued their strong form with a commanding 129-101 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers, marking their fifth win in the last six games. Jalen Suggs led the Magic with a season-high 23 points and seven assists, contributing significantly in the first half with 20 points and five 3-pointers, and then rested in the final quarter.

Off the bench, Anthony Black delivered an all-around performance with 12 points, four rebounds, four assists, and four steals.

The Magic will next host New York, while the Clippers continue their lengthy road trip with a visit to Charlotte.
