The Hornets, missing key players such as LaMelo Ball, Miles Bridges, and Mark Williams, relied on Brandon Miller's 20 points and Josh Green's pivotal plays, including a last-second steal and jumper. However, Brunson's mid-range shot with 4:50 left in the game gave the Knicks a lead they held onto. The Knicks will next face the Pelicans, while the Hornets prepare to host the Hawks.

**Portland Trail Blazers 115 - 106 Sacramento Kings**  
The Sacramento Kings snapped a four-game losing streak with a 115-104 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves, thanks in part to Jae Crowder's debut, where he contributed eight points and four rebounds.

Sacramento has dominated recent encounters against Portland, winning six of the last seven meetings, and will look to maintain their momentum as they face off in the NBA Cup.
