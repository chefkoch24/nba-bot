**Montreal Canadiens 3 - 2 Florida Panthers**  
Montreal Canadiens' Nick Suzuki scored two critical goals, one with nine seconds left in regulation and another just 29 seconds into overtime, to secure a dramatic 3-2 victory over the Florida Panthers, breaking a wild card tie in the NHL playoff race.

**Utah Hockey Club 3 - 1 Calgary Flames**  
In an impressive performance, Karel Vejmelka's 33 saves propelled the Utah Hockey Club to a 3-1 victory over the Calgary Flames at the Delta Center. Utah showcased a strong offensive effort with goals from Clayton Keller, Kevin Stenlund, and Barrett Hayton, marking their second consecutive win and bringing their record to 34-29-12. Despite an early lead from Stenlund's first-period one-timer and Hayton's quick backhand goal in the second, a potential tying goal by Mikael Backlund for the Flames was disallowed upon review, as the puck was deemed not to have crossed the line. The Flames’ Rasmus Andersson managed to cut the lead with a glove-side goal, but Keller sealed the victory for Utah with an empty-netter in the game's final moments. The Flames, struggling with recent performance, have now lost three of their last four games.
