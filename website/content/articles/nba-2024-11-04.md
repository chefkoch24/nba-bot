**New Orleans Pelicans 111 - 126 Atlanta Hawks**  
The Atlanta Hawks halted a four-game losing streak by defeating the short-handed New Orleans Pelicans 126-111, led by Jalen Johnson's 29-point performance. The Pelicans, missing key players including Zion Williamson due to a last-minute scratch for hamstring tightness, relied heavily on Brandon Ingram, who scored 32 points. However, this wasn't enough as Atlanta had six players scoring in double figures, with Trae Young contributing 23 points and Dyson Daniels coming off an injury to add 16 against his former team. The absence of notable Pelicans, such as Dejounte Murray and CJ McCollum, further compounded their struggles. A pivotal 14-0 fourth-quarter run by the Hawks, highlighted by David Roddy’s three-pointer and three dunks from Johnson, sealed the victory. This game also witnessed former Pelicans Nance Jr. and Daniels reveling in their performances against their previous team, adding a personal edge to the Hawks' win.

**Dallas Mavericks 108 - 85 Orlando Magic**  
In a dominant performance, Luka Dončić led the Dallas Mavericks to a convincing 108-85 victory over the Orlando Magic, tallying 32 points, nine rebounds, and seven assists. The Mavericks, last year's Western Conference champions, surged ahead with a commanding 30-9 run in the second quarter, culminating in a 65-40 halftime lead and extending their largest lead to 33 points. The Magic struggled without their star rookie and 2023 Rookie of the Year, Paolo Banchero, who was sidelined with a torn right oblique, and saw Wendell Carter Jr. limited by injury. Dallas capitalized on Orlando's shooting woes, as the Magic hit a season-low 19.5% of their three-point attempts. The Mavericks also dominated in fast-break points and rebounds, with Kyrie Irving contributing 17 points and Dereck Lively II adding 11 points and 11 rebounds off the bench. The Magic will face the Thunder next, while the Mavs will host the Pacers.
