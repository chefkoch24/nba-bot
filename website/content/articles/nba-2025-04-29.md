**Miami Heat 83 - 138 Cleveland Cavaliers**  
The Cleveland Cavaliers achieved the most lopsided series win in NBA playoff history by sweeping the Miami Heat in the first round, culminating in a 138-83 Game 4 victory. Led by Donovan Mitchell's 22 points, the Cavaliers built a lead as large as 60 points, with De’Andre Hunter, Ty Jerome, Evan Mobley, and Jarrett Allen all making significant contributions. Cleveland's series win was marked by a 122-point margin, breaking the previous record set by Denver in 2009. The 55-point victory in Game 4 ranks as the fourth-largest playoff win, showcasing Cleveland's dominance over a Miami team that entered the playoffs via play-in games. Miami's Nikola Jovic topped his team's scoring with 24 points, as the Heat suffered their third sweep in a best-of-seven series. With Cleveland advancing to face either Indiana or Milwaukee, the series highlighted the Cavs' consistent excellence throughout the season.

**Golden State Warriors 109 - 106 Houston Rockets**  
The Golden State Warriors took a commanding 3-1 series lead over the Houston Rockets with a 104-93 victory in Game 4, benefiting from Stephen Curry's standout performance. Curry overcame the absence of star forward Jimmy Butler, who missed the contest due to injury but is expected to return for the next game, by leading a comeback from a 13-point deficit and scoring 36 points, placing him 10th on the NBA’s all-time postseason scoring list. The Warriors' bench also contributed significantly, with Buddy Hield and Gary Payton II combining for 33 points. The Rockets, who had entered the fourth quarter holding a slight lead, were outscored 35-22 in the final period, failing to contain Curry’s explosive second half, where he added 21 points to his tally. While Fred VanVleet led Houston with 17 points, Jalen Green struggled, managing only nine points on 4-of-11 shooting, a stark contrast to his 38-point explosion in Game 2. The Warriors' defense effectively neutralized Green, contributing to their decisive victory.
