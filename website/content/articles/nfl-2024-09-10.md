**San Francisco 49ers 32 - 19 New York Jets**  
In a highly anticipated game, the San Francisco 49ers defeated the New York Jets 32-19, spoiling Aaron Rodgers' comeback. Stand-in running back Jordan Mason shined for the 49ers, rushing for 147 yards and a touchdown in place of the injured Christian McCaffrey. Rodgers, who returned exactly one year after a devastating Achilles injury, threw for 167 yards, one touchdown, and one interception, showing flashes of his former MVP self but also encountering mobility issues. The 49ers capitalized on eight consecutive scoring drives, with Jake Moody kicking six field goals, tying a franchise record, and Deebo Samuel adding a 2-yard TD run. Despite Rodgers connecting with Allen Lazard for a touchdown, the Jets struggled to maintain momentum, suffering from critical three-and-outs and turnovers. Key injuries included Jets CB Michael Carter (ankle) and 49ers LG Aaron Banks (calf). The 49ers will face Minnesota next, while the Jets head to Tennessee.

**Lions 26 - 20 Rams**  
The Detroit Lions triumphed in their season opener with a 26-20 overtime win against the Los Angeles Rams, highlighted by David Montgomery's decisive 1-yard touchdown run. The Lions, who narrowly avoided a loss after squandering a 17-3 third-quarter lead, managed to push the game into overtime thanks to a critical 32-yard field goal by Jake Bates in the final minute of regulation. Despite a valiant effort from Rams' quarterback Matthew Stafford, who threw for 317 yards and a touchdown, and Cooper Kupp's 14 receptions for 110 yards, the Rams were unable to hold off a determined Lions team. The game also saw key contributions from Jared Goff, who connected on a notable 52-yard touchdown pass to Jameson Williams, and the Lionsâ€™ balanced rushing attack. The Rams faced significant adversity with injuries to critical players like Puka Nacua, Joe Noteboom, and Steve Avila, yet coach Sean McVay stood by his aggressive strategies despite falling short.
