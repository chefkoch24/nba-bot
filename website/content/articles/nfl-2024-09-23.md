**Pittsburgh Steelers 20 - 10 Los Angeles Chargers**  
The Pittsburgh Steelers, led by an impressive performance from backup quarterback Justin Fields, secured a 20-10 victory over the Los Angeles Chargers to move to 3-0 for the first time since 2020. Fields threw for a touchdown, ran for another, and completed 25 of 32 passes for 245 yards, including a 55-yard TD strike to Calvin Austin III. Despite Fields' efficiency, the Steelers' defense was pivotal, limiting the Chargers to just 168 total yards. Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert, battling a right ankle injury, was pulled in the third quarter, leaving backup Taylor Heinicke to struggle against a relentless Steelers pass rush. Key injuries included Chargers' Joey Bosa and Steelers' Alex Highsmith, among others. The Steelers' offense capitalized late in the game to secure the win, with significant contributions from their offensive line and kicker Chris Boswell.

**Minnesota Vikings 34 - 7 Houston Texans**  
In a dominant 34-7 victory over the Houston Texans, the Minnesota Vikings showcased a fierce defense and impressive performance by Sam Darnold, who matched his career high with four touchdown passes. The Vikings improved to a 3-0 record as they kept C.J. Stroud under intense pressure, intercepting him twice and sacking him four times. Darnold connected with multiple receivers for touchdowns, including Justin Jefferson and Aaron Jones, while Jones additionally rushed for 102 yards. This win marked the largest winning margin for the Vikings in five years and continued their unbeaten streak against the Texans, who struggled with crowd noise and penalty issues. Stefon Diggs led the Texans with 10 catches for 94 yards in his first game in Minnesota since leaving the Vikings, but his efforts were not enough to lift the team.

**Las Vegas Raiders 22 - 36 Carolina Panthers**  
In a game that marked a significant turnaround for the Carolina Panthers, Andy Dalton stepped into the spotlight as he led his team to a 36-22 victory over the Las Vegas Raiders, securing their first win of the season. Elevated to starter after Bryce Young was benched, Dalton revived the Panthers' offense, throwing for 319 yards and three touchdowns. His impressive performance included 212 yards and all three TDs in the first half alone. Running back Chuba Hubbard also shined, rushing for 114 yards and adding a receiving touchdown. Wide receiver Diontae Johnson contributed with eight catches for 122 yards and a touchdown. The Panthers ended several prolonged droughts, including scoring on their opening drive and leading in the fourth quarter for the first time in 20 games. The Raiders struggled both offensively and defensively, with Gardner Minshew throwing for 214 yards and their running game managing only 55 yards. The defeat was compounded by injuries and ineffective play-calling. This game also marked the first NFL meeting between teams with female presidents, a historic milestone. Carolina will next face the Bengals, while Las Vegas will host the Browns.

**Seattle Seahawks 24 - 3 Miami Dolphins**  
The Seattle Seahawks secured a 24-3 victory over the Miami Dolphins, extending their perfect start to 3-0 under new coach Mike Macdonald. Geno Smith threw for 289 yards, including a 71-yard touchdown to DK Metcalf, and Zach Charbonnet added two rushing touchdowns. The game spotlighted Miamiâ€™s quarterback woes as Skylar Thompson exited with a rib injury, a week after Tua Tagovailoa suffered his third concussion in two years. Tim Boyle, stepping in for Thompson, failed to rally the Dolphins, who only managed a field goal. The Seahawks' defense continued its dominance, marking Seattle as the first team since the 1979 Steelers to start 3-0 while holding opponents to under 150 passing yards per game. Miami coach Mike McDaniel faces pressure to stabilize the team's quarterback situation, while the Seahawks aim to maintain their momentum on the road against Detroit.

**New Orleans Saints 12 - 15 Philadelphia Eagles**  
In a tightly contested defensive battle, Saquon Barkley propelled the Philadelphia Eagles to a 15-12 victory over the New Orleans Saints with two crucial fourth-quarter touchdowns, the first being a 65-yard dash and the second a 4-yard run following a pivotal 61-yard reception by Dallas Goedert. The game saw Barkley achieve redemption following his previous game's blunder and marked an intense comeback for the Eagles after a recent close defeat to Atlanta. Philadelphia's defense also shone, with Reed Blankenship intercepting Saints quarterback Derek Carr with mere seconds remaining, capping off an impressive afternoon for the Eagles, who outgained the Saints 460 to 219 in total yards. The contest, fraught with turnovers and strategic decisions, highlighted Jalen Hurts' 311 yards passing despite early struggles and critical injuries to key players on both sides.

**Tampa Bay Buccaneers 7 - 26 Denver Broncos**  
In their first win of the season, the Denver Broncos secured a 26-7 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, fueled by rookie quarterback Bo Nix's early rushing touchdown and four field goals from Wil Lutz. Nix, who was the 12th overall pick in the draft, displayed resilience after a rough start to the season by completing 25 of 36 passes for 216 yards without any interceptions. The Broncos' defense also shined, sacking Tampa Bay's Baker Mayfield seven times and intercepting him once, which set up a touchdown. While Mayfield managed a six-yard touchdown pass to Chris Godwin, the Buccaneers struggled overall, gaining only 223 yards and missing key players due to injuries. This game marked an important turnaround for the Broncos, who were at risk of beginning the season 0-3 for the second consecutive year.

**Dallas Cowboys 25 - 28 Baltimore Ravens**  
In a dramatic game, Lamar Jackson and Derrick Henry propelled the Baltimore Ravens to a narrow 28-25 victory over the Dallas Cowboys. Henry's impressive performance included 151 rushing yards and two touchdowns, making him the first Baltimore player to score in the first three games with the franchise. Jackson contributed significantly, both with his arm and legs, showcasing clutch plays in critical moments. Despite a late rally by Dak Prescott and the Cowboys, aided by an onside kick recovery, the Ravens managed to hold on. Brandon Aubrey's 65-yard field goal for Dallas fell just short of the NFL record, and the Cowboys' lackluster defense, which has allowed 120 points in their last three home games, remained a key issue. The Ravens, with their first win of the season, are trying to bounce back to playoff form after starting 0-2 for the first time since 2015.

**Arizona Cardinals 13 - 20 Detroit Lions**  
In a closely contested game, the Detroit Lions secured a 20-13 victory over the Arizona Cardinals, propelled by Jared Goff's impressive start and a resilient defensive performance. Goff threw two touchdown passes and completed his first 14 passes, marking the longest streak without an incompletion in his nine-year career. Detroit's defense shined in the second half, holding Kyler Murray and the Cardinals to just a field goal, with Aidan Hutchinson adding to his season sack total. David Montgomery contributed 106 rushing yards and a touchdown, while a well-executed hook-and-ladder play before halftime highlighted the Lions' offensive ingenuity. Although the Cardinals made several attempts to rally, including a critical interception by Goff that gave them good field position, Detroit's defense repeatedly thwarted their efforts, sealing the win with crucial stops and a key scramble by Goff for a first down late in the game.

**Los Angeles Rams 27 - 24 San Francisco 49ers**  
In a thrilling comeback, the Los Angeles Rams rallied from a double-digit deficit to stun the San Francisco 49ers with a 27-24 victory, capped by Joshua Karty's 37-yard field goal with just 2 seconds remaining. The Rams, missing top receivers and fresh off a 31-point loss, overcame a 14-point second-half gap and outscored the 49ers 20-3 in the final 19 minutes. Kyren Williams shined with three touchdowns, while Matthew Stafford threw for 221 yards. Despite Jauan Jennings' career-best 11 catches for 175 yards and three touchdowns for the 49ers, San Francisco failed to hold their lead, marking their first loss by such a margin since 2018. Both teams were plagued by injuries, missing key offensive playmakers. This win provided renewed hope for the Rams while leaving the 49ers frustrated and under .500 for the first time in Brock Purdy's tenure as a starting quarterback.

**Atlanta Falcons 17 - 22 Kansas City Chiefs**  
In a tightly contested Sunday night game, Patrick Mahomes threw two touchdown passes despite another interception, leading the Kansas City Chiefs to a 22-17 win over the Atlanta Falcons. Kansas City's defense was pivotal, making two critical fourth-down stops in the closing minutes to preserve the victory. Mahomes connected with Rashee Rice and JuJu Smith-Schuster for scores while Harrison Butker added three field goals. Falcons QB Kirk Cousins threw a touchdown to Drake London and set up another with a 50-yard pass, but Atlanta's offensive line injuries and a key interception by Chamarri Conner hindered their efforts. Controversy arose over a non-call on potential pass interference by Chiefs' safety Bryan Cook. Chiefs' replacements Carson Steele and Samaje Perine stepped up with notable contributions in Isiah Pacheco's absence, maintaining Kansas City's unbeaten record.

**Tennessee Titans 14 - 30 Green Bay Packers**  
In a stunning performance, Malik Willis showcased his potential by leading the Green Bay Packers to a 30-14 victory over his former team, the Tennessee Titans. Acquired in a late August trade, Willis ran for one touchdown and threw for another, amassing 202 passing yards and 73 rushing yards. The Packers' defense was also formidable, recording eight sacks and three turnovers, including a pick-six by Jaire Alexander. This win spotlights Willis' rapid adaptation under coach Matt LaFleur and serves as a statement game against the Titans, who have stumbled to an 0-3 start under first-year coach Brian Callahan. Despite Jordan Love sitting out to recover from a knee injury, the Packers improved to 2-1, while Will Levis, the Titans' chosen starter, continued to struggle with turnovers.

**Cleveland Browns 15 - 21 New York Giants**  
Rookie Malik Nabers made a significant impact in the New York Giants' 21-15 victory over the Cleveland Browns, catching two touchdown passes from Daniel Jones. The connections came in the first half, with Nabers becoming the youngest wide receiver in NFL history to have two TD receptions. Despite injuries to three offensive linemen, star quarterback Deshaun Watson rallied the Browns, who had several chances to take the lead in the fourth quarter, but the Giants' defense held firm, including recovering a crucial fumble. Jones completed 24 of 34 passes for 236 yards, and the Giants' defense sacked Watson eight times. Malik Nabers also made a critical play by breaking up a potential interception, highlighting his awareness and unselfish play. The Browns faced significant injuries, including potential season-altering concerns for All-Pro defensive end Myles Garrett.

**Indianapolis Colts 21 - 16 Chicago Bears**  
In a game that saw the Indianapolis Colts defeat the Chicago Bears 21-16, Jonathan Taylor was the standout performer with two touchdowns and 110 rushing yards, marking his second consecutive 100-yard game. Despite struggles from rookie quarterback Anthony Richardson, who completed only 10 of 20 passes with two interceptions, the Colts' defense stepped up, limiting the Bears to 63 rushing yards, forcing three turnovers, and sacking rookie Caleb Williams four times. Williams, who threw his first two NFL touchdown passes, also struggled under pressure, ending with two interceptions and a fumble that directly led to Taylor's game-sealing one-yard touchdown run. Even with Colts' injuries and a shaky start, the team's defensive resilience and Taylor's powerful running secured their first win of the season, while the Bears were left to reflect on missed opportunities and costly errors.
