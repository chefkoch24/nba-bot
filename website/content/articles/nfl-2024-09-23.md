**Pittsburgh Steelers 20 - 10 Los Angeles Chargers**  
The Pittsburgh Steelers improved to 3-0 for the first time since 2020 with a 20-10 victory over the Los Angeles Chargers, headlined by Justin Fields' standout performance. Fields threw for 245 yards, completing 25 of 32 passes, including a pivotal 55-yard touchdown to Calvin Austin III, and ran for another score. Despite dealing with injuries, Pittsburgh’s defense limited Los Angeles to just 168 total yards, while their offensive line dominated late in the game. Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert, who played through a right ankle issue, was eventually sidelined, leaving backup Taylor Heinicke to face a relentless Steelers pass rush. Key injuries for both teams included Joey Bosa for the Chargers and Alex Highsmith for the Steelers.

**Minnesota Vikings 34 - 7 Houston Texans**  
The Minnesota Vikings continued their undefeated streak with a commanding 34-7 victory over the Houston Texans, driven by Sam Darnold's four touchdown passes and a fierce defensive performance. The Vikings defense was relentless, sacking C.J. Stroud four times and intercepting him twice, leading to Houston's first loss of the season and disrupting their offense significantly. Jonathan Greenard notably sacked his former teammate Stroud three times, while Aaron Jones contributed with a solid 102 rushing yards and a receiving touchdown. Despite the hostile environment amplified by the crowd at U.S. Bank Stadium, Houston's Stefon Diggs made an impact with 10 catches for 94 yards in his return to Minnesota. However, the Texans struggled with penalties and only managed to score late in the third quarter. The game highlighted Minnesota's defensive prowess and marked their largest winning margin in five years.

**Las Vegas Raiders 22 - 36 Carolina Panthers**  
Andy Dalton, promoted to starting quarterback after Bryce Young was benched, catalyzed the Carolina Panthers to their first win of the season with a 36-22 triumph over the Las Vegas Raiders. Dalton threw for 319 yards and three touchdowns, displaying his veteran prowess and improving to a perfect 4-0 against the Raiders. The Panthers' offense, which had been abysmally outscored in their initial games, found new life with Dalton, Chuba Hubbard, who rushed for 114 yards and scored a touchdown, and Diontae Johnson, who had 122 receiving yards and a TD. The Panthers' defense also stifled the Raiders’ offense, which managed only 55 rushing yards. This game also marked the first NFL meeting between teams with female presidents, with Kristi Coleman for the Panthers and Sandra Douglass Morgan for the Raiders. Despite injuries on both sides, Carolina's early touchdowns and dominant play ended a series of droughts, including scoring on their opening drive and leading at the start of the fourth quarter for the first time in 21 games.

**Seattle Seahawks 24 - 3 Miami Dolphins**  
Seattle Seahawks triumphed over the Miami Dolphins with a 24-3 victory, marking a strong start to their season under new coach Mike Macdonald. Geno Smith led the Seahawks' offense, throwing for 289 yards, including a 71-yard TD to DK Metcalf, and Zach Charbonnet added two rushing touchdowns. However, the game was marred by yet another injury for the Dolphins' quarterbacks, with Skylar Thompson exiting due to a rib injury after Tua Tagovailoa's concussion the previous week, leaving Tim Boyle to finish the game. Despite Miami's efforts, including a failed drive from the Seattle three-yard line, their offense struggled with just 205 total yards. The Seahawks' defense shone, holding Miami's receiving duo of Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle to a mere 66 yards combined and limiting opponents to under 150 yards passing for three consecutive games, a feat not achieved since the 1979 Steelers.

**New Orleans Saints 12 - 15 Philadelphia Eagles**  
In a defensive showdown, the Philadelphia Eagles edged out the New Orleans Saints 15-12, thanks to two crucial fourth-quarter touchdowns by Saquon Barkley. Barkley rebounded from a previously costly drop to rush for scores of 65 and 4 yards, with the latter coming just after a 61-yard catch by Dallas Goedert, who had a career-high 170 receiving yards. The Eagles' defense was stellar, highlighted by Reed Blankenship's game-sealing interception of Derek Carr with 48 seconds left. Despite outgaining the Saints 460-219 in total yards, the Eagles were held scoreless for three quarters due to turnovers and strategic decisions. Injuries also played a role, with both teams losing key players throughout the game.

**Tampa Bay Buccaneers 7 - 26 Denver Broncos**  
Bo Nix, the Denver Broncos' rookie quarterback, secured his first NFL win by leading his team to a 26-7 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Nix contributed a 3-yard touchdown run and completed 25 of 36 passes for 216 yards without an interception, shaking off the mistakes from his first two games. Wil Lutz played a vital role by kicking four field goals. Denver's defense was impressive, sacking Baker Mayfield seven times and intercepting him once, which set up a crucial early touchdown. The Buccaneers struggled offensively, amassing only 223 yards, and could not capitalize on key opportunities, making this loss particularly disappointing after their road victory against Detroit the prior week. The Buccaneers, missing several key players due to injuries, failed to achieve a 3-0 start for the first time since 2005.

**Dallas Cowboys 25 - 28 Baltimore Ravens**  
In a thrilling game, the Baltimore Ravens held on to secure a 28-25 victory over the Dallas Cowboys, thanks to standout performances from Lamar Jackson and Derrick Henry. Henry rushed for 151 yards and two touchdowns, while Jackson accounted for two TDs, including clutch plays in the final moments to seal the win. The Ravens surged to an early 28-6 lead, but the Cowboys mounted a significant comeback, aided by an onside kick recovery. Despite Brandon Aubrey hitting a 65-yard field goal for Dallas and Dak Prescott passing for 379 yards and two scores, Baltimore's strong rushing game and timely defensive stops kept them in control. This victory was crucial for the Ravens, who avoided an 0-3 start, a near-certain playoff death sentence dating back to 2000. The game featured notable moments like Henry becoming the first Raven to score in each of his first three games and Dallas allowing the most rushing yards since their dismal 2020 season.

**Arizona Cardinals 13 - 20 Detroit Lions**  
In a closely contested game, Jared Goff's efficient first-half performance, where he completed his first 14 passes and threw for two touchdowns, set the tone for the Detroit Lions' 20-13 victory over the Arizona Cardinals. The Lions' defense played a crucial role in the second half, limiting Kyler Murray and the Cardinals to just one field goal and securing critical stops, including an interception by Kerby Joseph and a fourth-down stop. David Montgomery contributed with 106 rushing yards and a touchdown, while a key third-down pass to Amon-Ra St. Brown helped seal the win. The victory extended Detroit's unbeaten run against Arizona to six games since 2017.

**Los Angeles Rams 27 - 24 San Francisco 49ers**  
In a thrilling comeback, the Los Angeles Rams rallied from a double-digit deficit to defeat the San Francisco 49ers 27-24, thanks to a last-minute 37-yard field goal by Joshua Karty. Overcoming a 14-point deficit in the second half, the Rams were led by Kyren Williams, who scored three touchdowns, and Matthew Stafford, who passed for 221 yards. Despite missing key offensive players, both teams displayed resilience, with San Francisco's Jauan Jennings catching three touchdowns, his most impressive being a leaping 32-yard grab. The Rams' victory marked their biggest second-half comeback since 2006 and avoided a potential 0-3 start under Sean McVay, while the 49ers fell to 1-2 for the first time with Brock Purdy as their quarterback.

**Atlanta Falcons 17 - 22 Kansas City Chiefs**  
In a tightly contested game, Patrick Mahomes threw two touchdown passes and the Kansas City Chiefs' defense made crucial stops late in the fourth quarter to secure a 22-17 victory over the Atlanta Falcons. Despite Mahomes throwing his fourth interception of the season, he connected with Rashee Rice and JuJu Smith-Schuster for scores. The Chiefs' defense, particularly Nick Bolton, was pivotal, stopping Atlanta twice on fourth down in the closing moments, including a decisive tackle on Bijan Robinson. The Falcons, with quarterback Kirk Cousins, had a chance to win but were thwarted by Kansas City's defensive pressure and a controversial no-call on a potential pass interference. Kansas City's Harrison Butker also contributed with three field goals, while undrafted rookie Carson Steele led the ground game in Isiah Pacheco's absence. The Chiefs remain unbeaten, moving to 3-0 for the season.

**Tennessee Titans 14 - 30 Green Bay Packers**  
Malik Willis showcased his potential by leading the Green Bay Packers to a decisive 30-14 victory over the Tennessee Titans, his former team. Willis, acquired in a trade in late August, demonstrated his prowess with 202 passing yards, 73 rushing yards, and two touchdowns. Despite being flagged 10 times, the Packers excelled defensively with eight sacks and three forced turnovers, highlighted by Jaire Alexander's first career pick-6. Titans coach Brian Callahan, facing a dismal 0-3 start, expressed frustration with his team's performance. The game marked a stark contrast with Willis thriving in his new role while the Titans continued to struggle with quarterback Will Levis committing multiple turnovers.

**Cleveland Browns 15 - 21 New York Giants**  
In a dramatic game, rookie wide receiver Malik Nabers shone brightly for the New York Giants, catching two crucial touchdown passes from Daniel Jones to secure a 21-15 victory over the Cleveland Browns. The Giants built an early 21-7 lead but had to fend off a late Cleveland rally, punctuated by key defensive stops and a fumble recovery. Despite injuries to three offensive linemen, Browns' quarterback Deshaun Watson managed to keep the game close with two TD passes, but the Giants' defensive front sacked him eight times. Nabers’ standout moments included an impressive leap over a defender and a critical interception breakup. Additionally, Nabers became the youngest wide receiver in NFL history to record two TD receptions in a game at 21 years and 56 days old. The Giants overcame a shaky start, which included fumbling the opening kickoff and a missed field goal, to claim their first win of the season.

**Indianapolis Colts 21 - 16 Chicago Bears**  
In a closely contested game, the Indianapolis Colts secured a 21-16 victory over the Chicago Bears, driven by Jonathan Taylor's impressive performance and the team's resurgent defense. Taylor rushed for two touchdowns and 110 yards, marking his second consecutive game surpassing the 100-yard mark. The Colts' defense, which had been struggling, managed to limit the Bears to only 63 rushing yards, force three turnovers, and achieve a crucial goal-line stand. Despite rookie quarterback Caleb Williams’ career-high 363 passing yards and two touchdown passes for the Bears, he was under constant pressure, resulting in two interceptions and a fumble. The game was marked by gritty plays, including Taylor's decisive 1-yard TD run following a strip-sack, and a pivotal defensive stop by the Colts just before halftime.
