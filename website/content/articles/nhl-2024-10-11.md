**Buffalo Sabres 1 - 3 Los Angeles Kings**  
In their season opener, the Los Angeles Kings overcame the Buffalo Sabres 3-1, highlighted by Anze Kopitar’s spectacular third-period natural hat trick, which included the crucial go-ahead goal with just 1:38 left on the clock. Kopitar’s performance marked his seventh career hat trick and elevated him to sixth place in Kings history, surpassing Wayne Gretzky and Dustin Brown. He also became the seventh player in NHL history to achieve a natural hat trick in a season opener, achieving this feat for the second time in his career. Darcy Kuemper, newly acquired from Washington, was instrumental in goal, making 32 saves. Despite the Sabres initially controlling play, outshooting the Kings 27-11 in the first two periods and capitalizing on one of their five power plays with Alex Tuch's short-handed goal, they couldn’t sustain their lead, with Kopitar’s leadership and relentless scoring turning the tide. Also notable was Andre Lee's NHL debut for the Kings, and Jason Zucker celebrated his 700th NHL game for the Sabres.

Anthony Beauvillier emerged as a key player for Pittsburgh, scoring twice to aid the win. Despite Alex DeBrincat's two goals and an assist for Detroit and Vladimir Tarasenko scoring in his debut, the Red Wings couldn't maintain momentum, struggling defensively after a solid first period.

The game witnessed New Jersey's own changes, as Sheldon Keefe, making his coaching debut for the Devils after being dismissed by the Maple Leafs, saw his team unable to maintain their initial winning streak from the NHL Global Series in Czechia. An intriguing highlight was the decisive first period, where Toronto capitalized with three goals on just 11 shots, setting a tone that New Jersey couldn’t overcome despite goals from Jesper Bratt and Timo Meier.
