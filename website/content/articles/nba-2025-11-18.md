**Cleveland Cavaliers 118 - 106 Milwaukee Bucks**  
In a thrilling matchup, the Cleveland Cavaliers overcame an early deficit to defeat the Milwaukee Bucks 118-106, largely thanks to Donovan Mitchell's exceptional 37-point performance. This marked the fifth time this season Mitchell scored at least 35 points in a game. The Bucks suffered a significant setback when Giannis Antetokounmpo, who is one of the top scorers in the league, left the game in the second quarter due to a left groin strain. Prior to his injury, Giannis contributed 14 points, five rebounds, and four assists in just 13 minutes of play. Despite having seven players in double figures, the Bucks couldn’t prevent the Cavaliers from executing a strong late-game surge, powered by Sam Merrill's 20 points, including six 3-pointers. The Cavaliers have now secured victories in three of their last four games and continue their dominance over their Central Division rivals, boasting a remarkable 19-4 record against them since March 2024.

**Philadelphia 76ers 110 - 108 LA Clippers**  
The Philadelphia 76ers secured a comeback victory against the Los Angeles Clippers, winning 110-108 thanks to Tyrese Maxey's impressive 39-point performance. Paul George made his season debut for the Clippers, contributing nine points and seven rebounds after recovering from knee surgery. Despite being short-handed without stars like Joel Embiid and Kawhi Leonard due to injuries, the game remained tightly contested. The Clippers initially controlled the proceedings, leading by 10 points with less than 9 minutes remaining. However, a strong 14-3 run by the 76ers, sparked by Maxey, shifted the momentum. Andre Drummond played a crucial role in Embiid's absence, securing 14 points and 18 rebounds. James Harden scored 28 points and surpassed 28,000 career points, becoming the 11th player in NBA history to achieve this milestone. The game concluded with a dramatic final minute, where Philadelphia's lead was cut to two by Kobe Sanders' free throws, but Harden missed two potential game-winning three-pointers, sealing their 8-of-9 game losing streak.

The Miami Heat narrowly defeated the New York Knicks 115-113, holding off a late comeback attempt by New York. Norman Powell led Miami with 19 points, supported by Kel’el Ware’s impressive double-double of 16 points and 14 rebounds. Despite trailing by 10 points with just 3 minutes left, the Knicks mounted a furious rally, highlighted by Karl-Anthony Towns’ 22-point, 16-rebound performance, which included a crucial 3-pointer that brought New York within one point. The game’s final moments were dramatic; a New York basket was revoked due to an overturned goaltending call after replay. Miami’s Davion Mitchell extended the lead by a free throw, and the Heat held on as the Knicks' attempts to secure a tie were repeatedly thwarted, with Mitchell grabbing the final rebound to secure Miami’s victory. Both teams were missing key players due to injuries, and Miami benefited from a significant advantage in bench scoring, outpacing New York 43-28.

**Toronto Raptors 110 - 108 Charlotte Hornets**  
The Toronto Raptors secured a tight 110-108 victory over the Charlotte Hornets, fueled by RJ Barrett’s tiebreaking basket with 18 seconds left in the game. Brandon Ingram and Scottie Barnes delivered crucial defensive plays, each blocking pivotal shots in the final moments. Ingram, who dazzled the crowd with a spectacular dunk over rookie Ryan Kalkbrenner, scored 27 points, while Barnes and Barrett contributed 16 apiece. Immanuel Quickley's double-double of 15 points and 10 rebounds helped Toronto clinch their fourth consecutive win and eighth in the last nine games. Despite strong performances from Kon Knueppel, Miles Bridges, and LaMelo Ball, the Hornets, struggling with their long-range shooting at 10 for 40 from beyond the arc, dropped their sixth game in seven outings. LaMelo Ball made a return after an ankle issue, playing 27 minutes, but it wasn't enough to change the Hornets’ road woes. Notably, Barnes set a Raptors franchise record with his 10th consecutive game logging at least one block and one steal.

**Minnesota Timberwolves 120 - 96 Dallas Mavericks**  
The Minnesota Timberwolves secured a commanding 120-96 victory over the Dallas Mavericks, with Naz Reid leading the charge with a season-high 22 points, including 19 in the first half. Reid's efforts, capped by a last-minute third-quarter 3-pointer, thrust the Timberwolves into the final quarter with a dominant 32-point lead. Jaden McDaniels and Rudy Gobert contributed 15 points each, while star player Anthony Edwards had a subdued 13-point performance. Despite rookie Cooper Flagg and Brandon Williams scoring 15 points each for the Mavericks, the team struggled without key players like Anthony Davis, Daniel Gafford, and Dereck Lively II, who were either injured or resting. Dallas, which had recently beaten Portland, could not overcome its shooting woes, particularly from deep, finishing with only 9 of 30 successful 3-point attempts. The Timberwolves themselves also struggled from beyond the arc, continuing their trend of shooting under 33% in their last four games. Both teams are set to play at home on Wednesday, with Dallas hosting the New York Knicks and Minnesota hosting the Washington Wizards.

**Denver Nuggets 127 - 130 Chicago Bulls**  
The Chicago Bulls snapped the Denver Nuggets' seven-game winning streak with a 130-127 victory, even overcoming Nikola Jokic's impressive triple-double performance. Despite letting an 18-point lead slip and a 13-point advantage in the fourth quarter dissipate, the Bulls rallied late, with Kevin Huerter's key three-pointer giving them a late lead and Nikola Vucevic extending it in the final 33 seconds. Ayo Dosunmu and Josh Giddey both contributed 21 points to lead six Bulls in double figures, with Giddey also grabbing 14 rebounds. The Bulls dominated the bench scoring 66-9 and showed resilience despite having played a grueling double-overtime game the night before. Jokic's standout game included 36 points, 18 rebounds, and 13 assists for his eighth triple-double of the season, nearly securing it by halftime. Although Jamal Murray had a strong fourth quarter with 18 of his 34 points, it wasn't enough, as the Nuggets suffered their first home loss this season.
