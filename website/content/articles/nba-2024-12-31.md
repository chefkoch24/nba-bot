**Charlotte Hornets 108 - 115 Chicago Bulls**  
In an overtime thriller, the Chicago Bulls narrowly defeated the Charlotte Hornets 115-108 in Charlotte, with Coby White just missing out on his first career triple-double by logging 23 points, 10 rebounds, and nine assists. Torrey Craig emerged as a key player by scoring 18 points, including five crucial three-pointers in the second half, despite not playing in the first half. Nikola Vucevic also contributed significantly with 16 points and 13 rebounds. Miles Bridges shone for the Hornets with 31 points, 12 rebounds, and eight assists, but his efforts weren't enough as the team has now lost 16 of their last 17 games. Notably, the game saw key absences, with LaMelo Ball out for Charlotte due to wrist soreness and both Zach LaVine and Ayo Dosunmu missing for Chicago. Despite some late-game drama involving missed free throws and a clutch three from Bridges to send the game into overtime, the Bulls dominated the extra period to secure the win.

**Washington Wizards 106 - 126 New York Knicks**  
The New York Knicks defeated the Washington Wizards 126-106, marking their eighth consecutive win, highlighted by Josh Hart's impressive triple-double with 23 points, 15 rebounds, and 10 assists. Karl-Anthony Towns added 32 points and 13 rebounds to the Knicks' victory. Despite Jalen Brunson's quiet 18-point performance, the Knicks' depth proved too much for the undermanned Wizards, who played without their top scorer Jordan Poole and saw rookie Bub Carrington exit after a frightening fall during the game. This contest was the second matchup in three nights between the teams; the Knicks previously secured a high-scoring overtime win. OG Anunoby's key 3-pointers broke a 63-all tie, ensuring the Knicks maintained control from there. While the Knicks outrebounded the Wizards 54-46, Washington's Jonas Valanciunas matched his season high with 22 points. Now 23-10, the Knicks prepare to host Utah, while the Wizards aim for recovery against Chicago.

**New Orleans Pelicans 113 - 116 LA Clippers**  
In a closely contested game, the Los Angeles Clippers edged out the New Orleans Pelicans 116-113, with Norman Powell's 35-point performance leading the charge. James Harden was crucial in the closing moments, hitting go-ahead free throws with 17.9 seconds left and capitalizing on the Pelicans' rookie Yves Missi's crucial missed free throw in the final seconds. The game saw an unusual interruption when officials mistakenly called a jump ball after prematurely blowing the whistle on Missi's free throw. Ivica Zubac, who contributed 20 points and 16 rebounds, won the jump ball, securing the victory for the Clippers, while CJ McCollum's attempt from half court to tie the game fell short. Despite a strong showing, highlighted by a season-best 18 three-pointers, the Pelicans couldn't overcome their 10-game losing streak. The Clippers capitalized on their rebounds and second-chance points, maintaining their winning momentum by securing three consecutive victories and five wins out of their last six games.

**Utah Jazz 121 - 132 Denver Nuggets**  
In a commanding performance, Nikola Jokić led the Denver Nuggets to a 132-121 victory over the Utah Jazz with a triple-double, including 36 points, 22 rebounds, and 11 assists. Russell Westbrook also posted a triple-double with 16 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists, maintaining perfect shooting and no turnovers. Despite the Jazz having a halftime lead, Denver surged ahead with a dominant third quarter. The Jazz, currently struggling with a three-game losing streak, saw notable contributions from Jordan Clarkson and Collin Sexton but were hindered by turnovers, particularly in the second half, which the Nuggets capitalized on for extra points. Missing key players due to injuries, both teams adapted with Utah involving four rookies during a crucial period and the Nuggets lacking Aaron Gordon. The Jazz narrowed Denver's lead to two points in the fourth quarter, but Westbrook's defensive prowess and scoring sealed the victory for Denver.

**Golden State Warriors 95 - 113 Cleveland Cavaliers**  
The Cleveland Cavaliers, led by former Golden State assistant Kenny Atkinson, extended their dominance with a commanding performance against the Warriors, showcasing a high-tempo offensive system reminiscent of Golden State's own signature style. Atkinson's tactics have revitalized the Cavs, who arrived in San Francisco on a six-game win streak and the NBA’s best record. Cleveland's victory over the Denver Nuggets, scoring a season-high 149 points, emphasized their balanced scoring, with Donovan Mitchell spearheading the effort alongside multiple teammates scoring over 22 points. The Cavaliers' proficient three-point shooting, particularly notable for their league-leading 40.9 percent accuracy, has been pivotal to their success. Meanwhile, Golden State, fresh off a victory that lifted them above .500, is seeking additional scoring contributions beyond Steph Curry, who despite maintaining a solid scoring average, is on track for his lowest three-point conversions since the 2017-18 season. With Buddy Hield and Jonathan Kuminga emerging as potential key players, the Warriors aim to enhance their offensive depth as they compete for a playoff spot.

**Portland Trail Blazers 103 - 125 Philadelphia 76ers**  
The Philadelphia 76ers extended their winning streak to three games with a narrow 114-111 victory over the Utah Jazz, largely thanks to standout performances by Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey, who each scored 32 points. Embiid was especially effective, hitting 11 of his 13 free-throw attempts to help the Sixers recover from a 14-point first-half deficit. This win marked Philadelphia's ninth in twelve games, as they benefit from having Embiid in the lineup consistently for the first time this season. Meanwhile, the Portland Trail Blazers are showing signs of improvement, having recently secured a 126-122 win over the Dallas Mavericks. With a balanced scoring effort led by Shaedon Sharpe, Anfernee Simons, Deandre Ayton, Deni Avdija, and Scoot Henderson, the Blazers notched their second consecutive victory. Henderson's recent uptick in form has contributed to Portland's success, as his dynamic playmaking is energizing the team. Despite coach Chauncey Billups' absence due to a family bereavement, the Blazers appear to be internalizing his strategies, with veterans and young players alike contributing to the team's positive momentum.

**Sacramento Kings 110 - 100 Dallas Mavericks**  
The Sacramento Kings are eager to end a six-game losing streak as they host the short-handed Dallas Mavericks on Monday night. The Kings' first five losses occurred under coach Mike Brown, who was fired unconventionally on Friday after a crucial one-point defeat to the Detroit Pistons, highlighted by a game-winning four-point play from Detroit’s Jaden Ivey. Assistant Doug Christie stepped in as interim coach, managing a 132-122 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers, with De'Aaron Fox and Domantas Sabonis putting in notable performances. Despite a rocky start to the season, Sabonis is determined to turn things around, emphasizing his leadership role. The Mavericks, playing without Luka Doncic due to a calf strain, recently suffered a 126-122 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers despite Kyrie Irving's impressive 46-point effort. Irving expressed dissatisfaction with the team's recurring need to overcome early deficits but highlighted their resilience. The Mavericks will also be without Naji Marshall due to suspension, while Dereck Lively II remains questionable with a hip injury.
