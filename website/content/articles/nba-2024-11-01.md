**Memphis Grizzlies 122 - 99 Milwaukee Bucks**  
Ja Morant's impressive triple-double, featuring 26 points, 14 assists, and 10 rebounds, led the Memphis Grizzlies to a commanding 122-99 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks. This win snapped Memphis's two-game losing streak as Santi Aldama contributed 19 points and nine rebounds, and Scotty Pippen Jr. and Jaylen Wells each added 16 points. The Grizzlies' strong performance, with seven players scoring in double figures and shooting 52% from the field, contrasted with the Bucks' struggles, particularly Damian Lillard's 1-for-12 shooting night. Despite Giannis Antetokounmpo's 37-point effort, Milwaukee suffered its fourth consecutive loss. Morant's dynamic play, including a noteworthy assist while seated on the court, set the tone early, and Memphis's energy was evident from the outset against a faltering Bucks team.

**Dallas Mavericks 102 - 108 Houston Rockets**  
The Houston Rockets secured a 108-102 victory over the Dallas Mavericks, withstanding a late comeback from the defending Western Conference champions. Jalen Green led the Rockets with 23 points and 12 rebounds, while Alperen Sengun contributed 17 points and 12 rebounds. Houston's bench also played a crucial role, outscoring Dallas’ reserves 33-21. The Rockets had a robust third-quarter, leading by 23 points before Dallas, led by Luka Doncic’s 29 points and 15 fourth-quarter points, nearly closed the gap. Kyrie Irving added 28 points for the Mavericks. However, Dallas struggled with foul troubles for their center tandem, Daniel Gafford and Dereck Lively, and were outrebounded 50-37. A critical moment came when Amen Thompson countered a late Doncic three-pointer with a fadeaway jumper, maintaining Houston’s lead. The Mavericks were hampered by a poor shooting start, going 2 for 12 on 3-pointers in the first half. The Rockets now look forward to a three-game homestand starting against the Warriors, while the Mavericks prepare for a back-to-back home session against the Magic.

**Utah Jazz 88 - 106 San Antonio Spurs**  
In an impressive performance, Victor Wembanyama led the San Antonio Spurs to a 106-88 victory over the Utah Jazz in Salt Lake City, achieving at least five in five statistical categories for the second time in his career with 25 points, nine rebounds, seven assists, five steals, and five blocks. Chris Paul also contributed significantly with 19 points, 10 assists, and six rebounds. Despite the absence of their starting forward Lauri Markkanen due to back spasms, the Jazz initially led, powered by Patty Mills' three consecutive three-pointers. However, the Spurs overcame two double-digit deficits, taking the lead for good with a decisive 12-0 run in the third quarter, fueled by defensive plays from Julian Champagnie and Keldon Johnson. Utah's struggle to maintain consistent offense without Markkanen, along with their 26 turnovers resulting in 35 points for San Antonio, proved costly. Keyonte George had a career-high seven turnovers for the Jazz. The Spurs dominated the fourth quarter, securing a 20-point lead and setting up their next game against Minnesota, while Utah will face Denver.

**LA Clippers 119 - 125 Phoenix Suns**  
The Phoenix Suns executed a remarkable comeback to defeat the Los Angeles Clippers 125-119, overcoming a 21-point deficit. Devin Booker showcased his offensive prowess, scoring 40 points and sinking a crucial corner three-pointer in the final minutes. Kevin Durant contributed 18 points, helping ignite the Suns' second-half surge with 73 points scored. Phoenix's clutch performance also featured key contributions from Royce O'Neale and Ryan Dunn, who provided timely three-pointers. Despite a strong triple-double effort from James Harden, the Clippers were undone by a sloppy second half, characterized by stagnant play and eight turnovers. The Suns capitalized on these mistakes, transitioning swiftly into fast-break opportunities, and outpacing the Clippers in crucial moments to secure their second win at the Clippers’ new arena within a week. Bradley Beal's absence due to an elbow injury was offset by Phoenix's dominant team play.
