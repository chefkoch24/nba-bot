**Miami Heat 105 - 109 Philadelphia 76ers**  
Tyrese Maxey scored 37 points, Joel Embiid added 29, and the Philadelphia 76ers rallied past the Miami Heat 109-105 in a game filled with big runs by both teams. The 76ers opened a big lead, lost it, regained another lead, wasted that one as well, but ultimately closed out the game with a 15-3 run to secure the victory. Maxey was one rebound shy of a triple-double, Kelly Oubre Jr. scored 18 points, and the 76ers moved within a half-game of Miami for the No. 7 spot in the tightly contested Eastern Conference race. Despite a strong performance from Terry Rozier and Jimmy Butler, Miami couldn't hold on to the lead late in the game as the 76ers escaped with the win.

**New York Knicks 120 - 109 Sacramento Kings**  
Jalen Brunson had 35 points and Josh Hart scored a season-high 31 points as the New York Knicks rallied from a 21-point deficit to beat the Sacramento Kings 120-109, snapping a three-game losing streak. The Knicks were able to overcome the absence of Julius Randle, who is out for the season with shoulder surgery, and tied the Orlando Magic for the fourth-best record in the Eastern Conference. De'Aaron Fox led the Kings with 29 points, but Sacramento missed a chance to tie for sixth in the West. The Knicks used a strong fourth-quarter performance to secure the win, with Brunson and Hart leading the way.

**Houston Rockets 110 - 133 Golden State Warriors**  
Steph Curry and Klay Thompson each scored 29 points as the Golden State Warriors extended their winning streak to six games with a 133-110 victory over the Houston Rockets. Despite being in 10th place in the Western Conference, the Warriors never trailed, with Thompson contributing seven 3-pointers and rookie Trayce Jackson-Davis scoring a career-high 20 points. The win marked the Warriors' 13th consecutive regular-season victory over the Rockets, and they now have a winning season for the fourth year in a row. Houston's Jabari Smith Jr. led the Rockets with 24 points, but it wasn't enough to overcome defensive lapses that coach Ime Udoka criticized. The Warriors are set to face Dallas next, while the Rockets will host Miami in their next game.

**LA Clippers 102 - 100 Denver Nuggets**  
Kawhi Leonard's health status is a concern for the Clippers as they aim to secure a top-four spot in the Western Conference, with Leonard missing their game against the Nuggets due to knee soreness. The Nuggets, missing Jamal Murray due to knee inflammation, are also fighting for the top playoff seed in the West. The Clippers have a favorable schedule ahead with six of their last seven games at home, but their recent loss to the Kings highlighted the impact of Leonard's absence. Nikola Jokic has been a standout for the Nuggets, emphasizing the importance of playing every game as they look to replicate last season's success as the top seed in the West.

**Dallas Mavericks 109 - 95 Atlanta Hawks**

The Mavericks clinched a spot in the postseason and remain in fifth place in the Western Conference. Dallas is now in a rare stretch of three home games in four days and will face the Golden State Warriors in a back-to-back game. Kyrie Irving contributed 26 points for the Mavericks, while Bogdan Bogdanovic scored 17 points for the Hawks. The win helped Dallas maintain their position in the standings as they set their sights on the playoffs.
