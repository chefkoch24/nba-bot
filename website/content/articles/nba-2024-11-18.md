**Minnesota Timberwolves 120 - 117 Phoenix Suns**  
Julius Randle delivered a dramatic finish for the Minnesota Timberwolves, sinking a buzzer-beating 3-pointer to secure a 120-117 victory over the Phoenix Suns, despite his teammate Anthony Edwards being fined for a previous game incident and receiving a technical foul.

Despite leading by 16 points at one stage, the Suns allowed the Timberwolves to rally after halftime.

**Cleveland Cavaliers 128 - 114 Charlotte Hornets**  
The Cleveland Cavaliers improved to an impressive 15-0 record with a 128-114 victory over the Charlotte Hornets, showcasing their depth as Darius Garland scored 25 points and Ty Jerome matched his career-high with 24 points while filling in for Donovan Mitchell. This winning streak places the Cavs among elite company as only the fourth team to start a season 15-0, joining the ranks of the 2016 Golden State Warriors, 1994 Houston Rockets, and 1949 Washington Capitols. While key player Donovan Mitchell was rested, the Cavs hardly missed a step, with Evan Mobley adding 23 points and 11 rebounds, and Jarrett Allen contributing 21 points and 15 rebounds. Despite LaMelo Ball's strong performance of 31 points and 12 assists for Charlotte, the Hornets couldn't find defensive stops when needed. As first-year coach Kenny Atkinson continues his unbeaten run with the Cavs, the team looks ahead to facing the defending champion Boston Celtics. The win also provided an opportunity for Atkinson to develop his bench, highlighting the team's versatility and depth.

**Washington Wizards 104 - 124 Detroit Pistons**  
The Detroit Pistons decisively defeated the Washington Wizards 124-104, with standout performances from Cade Cunningham, who recorded a triple-double with 21 points, 10 assists, and 10 rebounds, and Jaden Ivey, who scored 28 points, alongside Malik Beasley's 26 points.

Detroit's dominance was evident early on as they held the Wizards to just 18 points in the first quarter and maintained a solid lead throughout, never allowing Washington to close the gap to single digits. Despite the Wizards shooting well from beyond the arc, their 17 turnovers and ineffective start hampered any comeback attempts. Rookie Alex Sarr struggled for Washington, scoring only four points, while Jordan Poole and Kyle Kuzma each contributed 22 points. This win reflects the Pistons' progress in their rebuild compared to a struggling Washington team that now endures an eight-game losing streak, with tougher matchups ahead against New York and Boston.

With this victory, the Grizzlies secured their fourth consecutive home win, while Denver continued its losing streak with two consecutive losses. Julian Strawther was Denver's top scorer with 19 points, but the team overall suffered from poor shooting, particularly missing the offensive firepower typically provided by Jokic.

The Nets, struggling with injuries and using Dorian Finney-Smith as an unconventional center, couldn't find an answer for the Knicksâ€™ size and defense. Cam Thomas, a bright spot for the Nets in previous games, was held to 16 points on 4-of-11 shooting after a standout performance on Friday.
