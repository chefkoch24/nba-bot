**San Francisco 49ers 34 - 40 Detroit Lions**  
In an exciting matchup largely devoid of playoff implications, the Detroit Lions managed to secure a 40-34 victory over the San Francisco 49ers, with quarterback Jared Goff throwing three touchdown passes, including a go-ahead score to Amon-Ra St. Brown late in the third quarter. Despite having an opportunity to rest starters, Lions coach Dan Campbell opted for a full-strength lineup, pushing for a win that provided a measure of revenge against their previous NFC Championship adversaries. Notably, the game featured dynamic offensive plays, including a thrilling hook-and-ladder touchdown from Goff to St. Brown and Jameson Williams. Kerby Joseph's two key interceptions against San Francisco's Brock Purdy were pivotal, as the Lions maintained their perfect road record this season and aimed to clinch the NFC North title in the final regular-season showdown against Minnesota. The game saw minor injuries, with Lions' Penei Sewell checking a thumb injury and Purdy sustaining an elbow issue, though initial tests showed no serious damage. The Lions will host a crucial divisional game against the Vikings next, while the 49ers face Arizona.
