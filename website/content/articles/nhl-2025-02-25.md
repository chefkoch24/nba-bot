**Winnipeg Jets 2 - 1 San Jose Sharks**  
The Winnipeg Jets achieved a franchise-record 10th consecutive victory by defeating the San Jose Sharks 2-1 in overtime at Canada Life Centre. Mark Scheifele scored the winning goal 1:33 into OT, making history with his 329th career NHL goal, surpassing Ilya Kovalchuk for the most goals in Jets/Atlanta Thrashers franchise history. The Jets, who last lost on January 20, tied the game late in the third period with Josh Morrissey's equalizer. Despite a strong performance from Sharks' goalie Vitek Vanecek with 33 saves, San Jose suffered their sixth straight loss. William Eklund scored the lone goal for the Sharks during a power play. Meanwhile, rookie Macklin Celebrini continued to impress, tying for the most points among rookies this season. The Jets' comeback win tied them with the Washington Capitals for the most such victories this season, and they join the Edmonton Oilers and New York Rangers as the only teams to reach double-digit win streaks in the NHL since last season.
