**Charlotte Hornets 108 - 107 Detroit Pistons**  
The Detroit Pistons secured a crucial road victory against the Charlotte Hornets, marking their third consecutive win after defeating the Brooklyn Nets and Los Angeles Lakers in earlier matchups. The Pistons' success was attributed to their disciplined play, notably committing only 12 turnovers in their 115-103 victory over the Lakers, as emphasized by coach J.B. Bickerstaff. Jaden Ivey was instrumental with a season-high 26 points and is credited with playing confidently and attacking with strength, leading him to be the Pistons' top scorer for the third time this season. Cade Cunningham also made a significant contribution with a triple-double, further highlighting his playmaking abilities. Despite this, the Hornets, led by LaMelo Ball who ranks as the NBA’s seventh-highest scorer, suffered a 114-93 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves and continued to battle injuries, including Brandon Miller’s recent return from a strained left glute and Nick Richards' right shoulder soreness. Charlotte struggled offensively, hitting just 23.8% of their three-point attempts, highlighting their scoring challenges.

Andrew Wiggins and Buddy Hield contributed 16 points each, while Draymond Green and Kyle Anderson sealed the game with free throws in the final seconds. Despite Jayson Tatum's impressive 32 points for Boston, the absence of Jaylen Brown due to injury proved costly for the Celtics, as their usually dynamic offense appeared sluggish. Notably, Warriors coach Steve Kerr was met with boos from the TD Garden audience, reflecting lingering discontent over his management of Tatum at the Paris Olympics.

Despite Zion Williamson's return and 29-point performance, including 23 in the second half, and Jose Alvarado's perfect seven-for-seven from beyond the arc, New Orleans couldn't sustain their early 12-point lead. The Cavaliers were bolstered by 50 points from their reserves and shot 54.2% overall, maintaining their unbeaten streak.

**Phoenix Suns 115 - 112 Miami Heat**  
The Phoenix Suns secured their sixth consecutive win by overcoming a 15-point deficit to edge the Miami Heat 115-112, with Kevin Durant leading the charge with 32 points. Jusuf Nurkic contributed a significant double-double of 20 points and 18 rebounds, while Devin Booker added 22 points and nine assists.

Despite committing 16 turnovers leading to 20 points for Miami, Phoenix managed to maintain composure, aided by Bradley Beal’s crucial late-game three-pointer. Tyler Herro was the standout for Miami with 28 points, but the Heat fell short, struggling particularly in the shooting efficiency of Bam Adebayo, who was just 5 for 21.
