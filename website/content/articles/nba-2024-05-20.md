**Denver Nuggets 90 - 98 Minnesota Timberwolves**  
Anthony Edwards led the Timberwolves to a stunning 98-90 Game 7 win over the reigning NBA champion Nuggets after overcoming a 20-point deficit thanks in part to a 15-point halftime comeback, marking the largest in Game 7 playoff history. Despite struggling with his shooting, Edwards finished with 16 points, eight rebounds, and seven assists, along with key defensive stops on Jamal Murray. Minnesota advances to the Western Conference finals for the first time in 20 years, facing the Dallas Mavericks next, as the Nuggets became the fifth straight defending champion to fail to reach the conference finals.
