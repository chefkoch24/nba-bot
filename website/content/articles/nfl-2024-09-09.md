**Buffalo Bills 34 - 28 Arizona Cardinals**  
In a thrilling season opener, the Buffalo Bills, led by Josh Allen, overcame a 14-point deficit to defeat the Arizona Cardinals 34-28. Allen, showcasing his dual-threat capabilities, threw for two touchdowns and ran for two more, including a spectacular leap over Budda Baker. The Bills' comeback was highlighted by Allen completing 18 of 23 passes for 232 yards and distributing the ball to nine different receivers, despite the offseason changes in their receiving corps. Buffalo's defense also played a crucial role, with Greg Rousseau recording three sacks, one leading to a decisive fumble recovery. The game featured the NFL's first kickoff return for a touchdown under new rules. Despite a solid start, Arizona's inability to maintain momentum saw their 17-3 early lead evaporate, with Kyler Murray contributing 162 passing yards, a touchdown, and leading the team in rushing. Rookie receiver Marvin Harrison Jr., in his NFL debut, had minimal impact. The Bills' victory was sealed when Damar Hamlin and Ja’Marcus Ingram broke up a late Cardinals' pass attempt near the goal line.

**Cincinnati Bengals 10 - 16 New England Patriots**  
In Jerod Mayo's coaching debut, the New England Patriots secured a 16-10 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals, thanks to a strong ground game led by Rhamondre Stevenson, who rushed for 120 yards and a touchdown, and efficient play from quarterback Jacoby Brissett. Brissett, a seasoned journeyman, was chosen to start over rookie Drake Maye and managed the game effectively, completing 15 of 24 passes for 121 yards. The Bengals, plagued by mistakes, including three costly turnovers, struggled to find their rhythm. Despite a late push, led by Joe Burrow and a fumble recovery touchdown by Zack Moss, the Bengals fell short. Patriots' owner Robert Kraft celebrated the win, expressing pride in the new team dynamic and giving Mayo a game ball.

Notably, Dobbins had two of his longest career runs in the second half, with a 46-yard burst setting up a field goal and a 61-yard run leading to a decisive Herbert-to-McConkey touchdown. Defense was also key, with the Chargers creating three turnovers. The game featured a fight leading to the ejection of Joshua Palmer and Josh Jones, and a notable play by Alexander Mattison, who scored a 31-yard touchdown for the Raiders.

In his debut as the youngest head coach in the NFL, Mike Macdonald led the Seattle Seahawks to a 26-20 victory over the Denver Broncos. Despite a shaky start, including a sack and interception on the first two plays, Seattle mounted a strong second-half rally powered by Kenneth Walker III, who gained 84 of his 103 rushing yards and scored a touchdown after halftime. Geno Smith contributed with a career-long 34-yard touchdown run and a crucial 30-yard touchdown pass to Zach Charbonnet. Denver scored two rare safeties in the second quarter, but their rookie QB Bo Nix struggled, throwing two interceptions among the Broncos' three turnovers.

**New York Giants 6 - 28 Minnesota Vikings**  
In a compelling game at MetLife Stadium, Sam Darnold led the Minnesota Vikings to a dominant 28-6 victory over the New York Giants. Darnold, returning to his former home turf, completed his first 12 passes and threw two touchdown passes, showcasing the performance Jets fans once dreamed of. Andrew Van Ginkel highlighted the game with a spectacular one-handed interception return for a touchdown, underscoring the strong defensive display from the Vikings. Despite a fumble recovery by Bobby Okereke that set up the Giants' only score, New York struggled offensively and saw Daniel Jones throw two interceptions. Justin Jefferson made a notable impact with four catches for 59 yards, including a touchdown. The Giants' struggles were compounded by a lack of offensive rhythm and pressure on Darnold, despite new additions like edge rusher Brian Burns. Both teams dealt with injuries, with the Vikings' WR Jordan Addison and several Giants players getting banged up. The Vikings look ahead to hosting San Francisco, while the Giants travel to Washington next Sunday.

**Chicago Bears 24 - 17 Tennessee Titans**  
In a dramatic comeback, the Chicago Bears managed to pull off a 24-17 victory over the Tennessee Titans despite a rocky debut by quarterback Caleb Williams. Williams, the No. 1 overall draft pick, struggled with accuracy and finished with just 93 yards passing, but became the first top pick since 2002 to win his first start. The Bears' defense and special teams played pivotal roles, highlighted by Tyrique Stevenson's 43-yard interception return for a touchdown and Jonathan Owens’s blocked punt recovery for another score. Chicago overcame a 17-0 first-half deficit and secured the win with Jaylon Johnson's interception in the final minutes. This victory marks the second time in the Super Bowl era that a team has won after trailing by 17 points without scoring an offensive touchdown, the first being the 2006 Chicago Bears.

In a dominant season opener, Derek Carr led the New Orleans Saints to a 47-10 victory over the Carolina Panthers, marking the highest-scoring debut for new offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak. Carr threw three touchdown passes, including a 59-yard strike to Rashid Shaheed on the opening series, and completed 19 of 23 passes for 200 yards. The Saints capitalized on strong defensive plays, highlighted by Alontae Taylor's historic three sacks and multiple turnovers. Alvin Kamara and Jamaal Williams each scored rushing touchdowns, and Blake Grupe kicked four field goals, two from beyond 50 yards. On the opposing side, Carolina's second-year quarterback Bryce Young struggled, completing 13 of 30 passes for 161 yards with two interceptions. Despite a significant overhaul in the Panthers' coaching and roster, new head coach Dave Canales faced a rough start, with Young managing only one rushing touchdown in the lopsided loss.

**Atlanta Falcons 10 - 18 Pittsburgh Steelers**  
In the season opener, the Pittsburgh Steelers secured an 18-10 victory over the Atlanta Falcons, largely thanks to kicker Chris Boswell, who accounted for all of Pittsburgh's points with six field goals, three from over 50 yards. Stepping in for an injured Russell Wilson, Justin Fields managed a steady performance at quarterback without major errors, completing 17 of 23 passes for 156 yards. The Steelers' defense was formidable, highlighted by two interceptions from Kirk Cousins and a fumble recovery by T.J. Watt. Boswell also handled a crucial punt after Cameron Johnston was injured. Despite his costly mistakes, Cousins managed to throw a touchdown, but ultimately, Atlanta still faces pressing questions about their quarterback situation under new head coach Raheem Morris.

**Cleveland Browns 17 - 33 Dallas Cowboys**  
In their season opener, the Dallas Cowboys, led by quarterback Dak Prescott, decisively defeated the Cleveland Browns 33-17. Prescott, fresh off signing a historic four-year, $240 million contract, which makes him the NFL's highest-paid player at $60 million per season, threw a touchdown pass and completed 19 of 32 passes for 179 yards before spending much of the second half on the sidelines. Cowboys kicker Brandon Aubrey added a significant contribution with field goals from distances of 57, 50, 46, and 40 yards. The Cowboys' defense overwhelmed Browns' QB Deshaun Watson, who struggled with six sacks and two interceptions in his first game back since a shoulder injury. The Browns' offense was notably ineffective, trailing significantly by halftime. Myles Garrett, Cleveland’s star defender, made headlines by surprising fans at a pregame tailgate, but his presence wasn't enough to rally his team. Injuries to key players on both sides, including Browns’ TE David Njoku and Cowboys’ TE Jake Ferguson, added to the game’s dramatic narrative.

**Tampa Bay Buccaneers 37 - 20 Washington Commanders**  
Baker Mayfield led the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to a 37-20 victory over the Washington Commanders, throwing for 289 yards and four touchdowns, effectively spoiling the pro debut of No. 2 overall draft pick Jayden Daniels. Key players like Mike Evans and Chris Godwin played pivotal roles, with Evans catching two touchdown passes and Godwin securing one. Despite multiple injuries in their secondary, the Bucs' defense managed to stymie Daniels, who excelled more in rushing, scoring two touchdowns on the ground. Mayfield's efficient performance, highlighted by his 24 completions on 30 attempts without an interception, demonstrates why he was recently rewarded with a three-year, $100 million contract. The game also included a notable helmet-to-helmet hit by Bucs' safety Antoine Winfield Jr. on Daniels, leading to an unnecessary roughness penalty but no ejection.

**Detroit Lions 26 - 20 Los Angeles Rams**  
The Detroit Lions opened their season with a dramatic 26-20 overtime victory over the Los Angeles Rams, thanks to David Montgomery's 1-yard touchdown run. The Lions initially held a 17-3 lead, bolstered by Jared Goff's 52-yard touchdown pass to Jameson Williams, but saw it evaporate as the Rams' Matthew Stafford connected with Cooper Kupp for a go-ahead touchdown late in the fourth quarter. Goff then led a drive that resulted in a tying 32-yard field goal by Jake Bates, sending the game into overtime. The Lions capitalized on winning the coin toss, driving steadily to set up Montgomery's winning score. Despite significant injuries, including the loss of Pro Bowl receiver Puka Nacua, the Rams were competitive, but ultimately fell short. Stafford threw for 317 yards and Kupp tied his career high with 14 receptions, while Goff passed for 217 yards. Montgomery ended with 91 rushing yards and a crucial overtime touchdown.

**Miami Dolphins 20 - 17 Jacksonville Jaguars**  
In a dramatic game that started with off-field chaos, the Miami Dolphins triumphed over the Jacksonville Jaguars 20-17, thanks to a last-second 52-yard field goal by Jason Sanders. The Dolphins secured their fourth consecutive season opener win despite two players, including star receiver Tyreek Hill, being handcuffed by Miami-Dade Police hours before kickoff. Quarterback Tua Tagovailoa threw for 336 yards and a touchdown, leading an eight-play drive in the final minutes to set up the winning field goal. Hill energized Miami’s comeback with an 80-yard touchdown catch, while defensive plays by Jevon Holland and key sacks helped seal the victory. Notable moments included Hill's handcuffed celebration mimicking his pre-game arrest, and rookie Brian Thomas Jr.'s impressive debut for the Jaguars.

**Indianapolis Colts 27 - 29 Houston Texans**  
In a thrilling season opener, the Houston Texans edged out the Indianapolis Colts 29-27, thanks to impressive debuts from Stefon Diggs and Joe Mixon. Diggs caught two crucial touchdowns, while Mixon ran for a career-high 159 yards and a score. C.J. Stroud, who went 24 of 32 for 234 yards, showcased his prowess in leading the Texans to their ninth consecutive road win in divisional play. Despite a valiant effort from Colts' rookie quarterback Anthony Richardson, who threw two TD passes over 50 yards and ran for another, the Colts' defense faltered under pressure. Notable plays included Nico Collins' 117-yard receiving game and Ka’imi Fairbairn’s three long-range field goals. The game had an unusual half-time clock review that cost Houston potential points and was marked by issues with the newly installed turf, causing multiple player slips. The Texans will host the Bears next, while the Colts head to Green Bay.
