**Buffalo Bills 30 - 27 Miami Dolphins**  
In a dramatic showdown, the Buffalo Bills secured a 30-27 victory over the Miami Dolphins thanks to Tyler Bass's franchise-record 61-yard field goal with five seconds remaining. The game witnessed a thrilling back-and-forth between Buffalo's Josh Allen and Miami's Tua Tagovailoa, culminating in seven consecutive scoring drives in the second half. Allen, who overcame a rocky first half, threw three touchdown passes after halftime, helping the Bills extend their dominance over the Dolphins with their sixth straight win. Tagovailoa, returning from a concussion, performed well but was ultimately outdone as the Dolphins suffered their third consecutive loss, including their second straight loss by a last-second field goal. The victory bolstered Buffalo's lead in the AFC East, while Tagovailoa and Miami struggled despite a commendable effort.

In a commanding performance, Justin Herbert threw for 282 yards and two touchdowns, leading the Los Angeles Chargers to a 27-10 victory over the Cleveland Browns. Herbert exploited communication breakdowns in Cleveland's secondary, resulting in touchdown passes to Quentin Johnston and Joshua Palmer, both involving Browns cornerback Denzel Ward. The Chargers' defense effectively neutralized Jameis Winston, intercepting him three times and sacking him six times. Rookie Tuli Tuipulotu contributed 2.5 of those sacks, while Tarheeb Still, Elijah Molden, and Alohi Gilman each nabbed interceptions. Despite the Browns' hopes after Winston's previous stellar performance replacing Deshaun Watson, they struggled, gaining only 57 yards in the first half. Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh reflected on his Ohio ties during a postgame interview, while trade rumors surrounded Browns defensive end Za’Darius Smith. Los Angeles improved to 5-3 and is set to host Tennessee next, while Cleveland, now 2-7, enters a bye week before facing New Orleans.

The Vikings' defense forced Indianapolis quarterback Joe Flacco, making his return to the starting lineup, into an interception and crucial turnovers, halting a Colts drive late in the game. Kenny Moore II's 38-yard fumble return provided the Colts their only touchdown, as the team's streak of close games this season ended. Despite the victory, Darnold and Coach Kevin O'Connell discussed the need to address turnovers moving forward, highlighting the team's resilience as a key strength.
