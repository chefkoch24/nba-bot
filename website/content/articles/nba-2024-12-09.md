**Chicago Bulls 100 - 108 Philadelphia 76ers**  
In Joel Embiid's return to the court, he led the Philadelphia 76ers to a 108-100 victory over the Chicago Bulls with a standout performance, scoring 31 points and grabbing 12 rebounds. Tyrese Maxey achieved his first career triple-double, contributing 25 points, 14 assists, and 11 rebounds, while Paul George and Kelly Oubre Jr. added 12 points each, marking the 76ers' fourth win in five games.

Embiid, wearing a knee brace and playing his first game after missing seven due to injuries and suspension, helped his team maintain composure as Chicago's robust opening was countered by a strong Sixers comeback. The game marked a rare occasion where Philadelphia's All-Star trio, including Maxey and George, played together this season, underscoring their potential synergy if healthy.
