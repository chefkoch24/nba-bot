**Tennessee Titans 14 - 23 Houston Texans**  
The Houston Texans secured a 23-14 victory over the Tennessee Titans, solidifying their place in the playoffs and preparing to host the AFC wild-card game against the Los Angeles Chargers. C.J. Stroud efficiently led the opening drive with a touchdown before being substituted, as the Texans ended their two-game losing streak and celebrated their second consecutive AFC South title. Running back Dameon Pierce highlighted the game with a career-high 176 rushing yards, including a spectacular 92-yard touchdown. The Titans, despite their struggles, gained the No. 1 overall draft pick due to their 3-14 season, a position Titans coach Brian Callahan hopes to avoid in the future. Defensive end Derek Barnett was a standout for the Texans with a 36-yard fumble return touchdown, and both teams faced injury challenges. As the Texans aim to win another wild-card game, the Titans face crucial decisions for their future, including possible changes in their quarterback lineup.

**Atlanta Falcons 38 - 44 Carolina Panthers**  
In an intense NFC South showdown, the Carolina Panthers edged out the Atlanta Falcons 44-38 in overtime, with Bryce Young showcasing a stellar performance by accounting for five touchdowns—three through the air and two on the ground. Young's efforts included leading a decisive 70-yard overtime drive, culminating in Miles Sanders' game-winning 1-yard touchdown run. Despite putting up impressive numbers, with rookie Michael Penix Jr. throwing for 312 yards and contributing to three touchdowns, the Falcons saw their playoff dreams dashed as Tampa Bay's victory over New Orleans clinched the division. The game highlighted key performances from players like Drake London, who amassed 187 yards and two touchdowns, and Bijan Robinson, who rushed for 170 yards. Both teams showed potential with promising young quarterbacks but ultimately ended the season with playoff aspirations unfulfilled, marking their seventh consecutive losing seasons. The Panthers and Falcons now look to the offseason for crucial decisions and draft strategies.

**Tampa Bay Buccaneers 27 - 19 New Orleans Saints**  
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers clinched the NFC South with a 27-19 victory over the New Orleans Saints, highlighted by wide receiver Mike Evans surpassing 1,000 receiving yards for the 11th straight season, tying an NFL record held by Jerry Rice. Quarterback Baker Mayfield, who had previously been winless when trailing by 10 or more points, led a comeback, throwing for 212 yards and two touchdowns and rushing for a career-high 68 yards, including a crucial 28-yard scramble. Rookie Jalen McMillan caught a toe-tapping touchdown to help secure the win, despite his earlier unsportsmanlike penalty. For the Saints, it capped off a disappointing season that began with promise but ended under interim head coach Darren Rizzi. Tampa Bay now prepares to host a wild-card playoff game against the Washington Commanders, while the Saints face an offseason head coaching search.

**Los Angeles Rams 25 - 30 Seattle Seahawks**  
In an exciting finish to the regular season, Geno Smith led the Seattle Seahawks to a 30-25 victory over the Los Angeles Rams, throwing a career-high four touchdown passes, including a game-winning throw to Noah Fant. The Rams, despite resting most of their starters including QB Matthew Stafford, narrowly missed a comeback under backup Jimmy Garoppolo, who threw for 334 yards and two touchdowns. The loss dropped the Rams to the fourth seed in the NFC playoffs, setting them up for a wild-card matchup against the Minnesota Vikings. Seattle, despite achieving its first ten-win season in four years under new coach Mike Macdonald, missed the playoffs because of the NFL's competitiveness. The game marked a potential farewell for Seattle's Tyler Lockett, facing salary cap implications, while injuries plagued both teams, with key players like Rams RB Blake Corum out for the season. The Rams aim to regroup for their home playoff game, while the Seahawks face an offseason filled with pivotal roster decisions.

**New England Patriots 23 - 16 Buffalo Bills**  
The New England Patriots capped off a challenging season with a 23-16 victory over the Buffalo Bills, costing themselves the top pick in the upcoming NFL draft, as rookie quarterback Joe Milton III impressed with both a running and passing touchdown in his professional debut. Despite the win, the triumph wasn't enough to save head coach Jerod Mayo's job, as he was dismissed shortly after the game, leaving the Patriots with the fourth pick in the draft instead. Notable performances included Kayshon Boutte's contribution of 117 yards and a touchdown, while Joey Slye sealed the game with a critical 50-yard field goal. For the Bills, who rested their starters with playoffs in mind, Mitchell Trubisky connected for their 30th passing TD, becoming the first NFL team to achieve 30 touchdowns both in the air and on the ground in a single season, with running back James Cook tying a franchise rushing TD record.

**New York Jets 32 - 20 Miami Dolphins**  
In a potential farewell game, veteran quarterback Aaron Rodgers led the New York Jets to a 32-20 victory over the Miami Dolphins, throwing four touchdown passes to bring his career total to 503, joining an elite group of quarterbacks with over 500 regular-season TDs. Despite an interception on his first throw, Rodgers connected with Tyler Conklin, Davante Adams, Allen Lazard, and Breece Hall, sealing the win against a Miami team desperate for a playoff spot. As the Jets face a restructuring offseason with new leadership, Rodgers remains undecided about his future in the NFL or with the team. Meanwhile, Dolphins star receiver Tyreek Hill hinted at a departure from Miami, adding intrigue to their offseason. The game also saw standout performances including Davante Adams surpassing 1,000 receiving yards for the fifth straight season, and De'Von Achane rushing for 121 yards for Miami, but the Jets' defensive takeaways ultimately stifled Miami's efforts. An unusual pregame mishap occurred with an upside-down team banner, and Jets DL Quinnen Williams and OL Carter Warren both suffered injuries during the game.

**Indianapolis Colts 26 - 23 Jacksonville Jaguars**  
In an exciting finish to the NFL season, the Indianapolis Colts earned a 26-23 overtime victory against the Jacksonville Jaguars, propelled by standout performances from Jonathan Taylor and veteran quarterback Joe Flacco. Taylor rushed for an impressive 177 yards, his fourth consecutive 100-yard game, and played a crucial role in overtime by setting up Matt Gay's decisive 38-yard field goal. Flacco, approaching his 40th birthday, delivered a notable 264-yard passing performance, reminiscent of his Super Bowl MVP days, which may mark his final appearance on the field. As the Colts celebrate the retention of coach Shane Steichen and GM Chris Ballard for another year, the Jaguars face uncertainty, with potential leadership changes on the horizon after a disappointing season. Highlights included a career-best 34 carries for Taylor, Alec Pierce's 40-yard touchdown reception from Flacco, and crucial plays by the Colts' defense to seal the win.

**Denver Broncos 38 - 0 Kansas City Chiefs**  
Nix leads Broncos past Chiefs' reserves 38-0 and into playoffs for 1st time since 2015 season0:21Broncos rout Chiefs to clinch playoff berthThe Broncos defeat the Chiefs 38-0 in Week 18 to secure a spot in the playoffs, setting up a matchup with the Bills in the wild-card round.ByAPJan 5, 2025, 09:31 pmFacebookFacebook MessengerTwitterEmailDENVER -- — Bo Nix celebrated the end of Denver's eight-year playoff drought with a bunch of new friends.              The rookie quarterback circled Empower Field while handing out high-fives to fans after he passed for 321 yards and four touchdowns in a 38-0 rout of the Kansas City Chiefs’ bevy of backups on Sunday.              “I learned I’ve got to run a little more during the week because that’s a long lap," Nix said. “I was a little tired at the end. But the fans deserve it, it’s been a long time coming.”              Denver (10-7) buried nearly a decade’s worth of futility and frustrations by returning to the postseason party for the first time since winning Super Bowl 50 following the 2015 season.              The Broncos will visit Buffalo (13-4) for a wild-card game Sunday after handing the two-time defending Super Bowl champion Chiefs their first shutout since Dec. 16, 2012, at Oakland.              Nix went 26 for 29 while setting franchise records for completion percentage (89.7) and most completions to start a game (18).              “It's fun to clinch a playoff spot in the last game of the year against a divisional team,” said Nix, who also set an NFL record with 19 touchdown throws at home in his rookie season. "But now playoff time starts, and our goal wasn't just to make the playoffs, even though it hadn't been done in a while.”              Having already secured the AFC’s No. 1 seed and sole first-round bye in their quest for an unprecedented three-peat, Chiefs coach Andy Reid sat Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce and a host of other starters.              “My hat goes off to Denver. Great opportunity for them to get into the playoffs and did a nice job today,” Reid said. “Sean (Payton) has done a good job with that group. A positive for us we got to play a lot of young guys. That experience is invaluable, especially against a good football team.” Carson Wentz got the start at quarterback and fizzled in his first extended action since Week 18 with the Rams last season. He was 10 of 17 for 98 yards and was sacked four times by the league's best pass rush (62 sacks).              “We didn’t play great as a team. I didn’t play my best, either,” Wentz said. “Move on from this one pretty quick. It was fun to get out there, give myself and a lot of guys a chance to just go out there and compete. But obviously they were the better team today.”              Denver beat Kansas City (15-2) for just the second time in the last 19 games between the teams.              Nix's four TD passes gave him 29 for the season, second-most by a rookie in NFL history, behind only Justin Herbert's 31 in 2020. He hit Marvin Mims twice, Courtland Sutton (five times for 98 yards) and Devaughn Vele for scores.               Vele's TD was intended for Adam Trautman but ricocheted off cornerbacks Nazeeh Johnson (twice) and Keith Taylor before Vele cradled the catch just before tumbling out of the back of the end zone, extending Denver's lead to 21-0.              “Vele ran the wrong route,” Nix said, “but he didn't give up on the play. ... Actually, it was perfect. I'm glad he did exactly what he did and he got a touchdown out of it.”              That wild conclusion capped an 18-play, 89-yard drive that lasted more than 11 minutes, keeping Wentz cooling his cleats on the sideline next to Mahomes, who was decked out in a white hoodie.              “It felt like it lasted forever,” Payton said.              The Chiefs certainly concurred.              After Harrison Butker was wide left on a 51-yard field goal — his first miss in 18 tries at Empower Field at Mile High — Wil Lutz gave Denver a 24-0 halftime lead by nailing a 33-yarder with 3 seconds left that came right after Nix's first incompletion, to a wide-open Javonte Williams.              “I'll kick myself for a while for not going 19 for 19 and hitting Javon for a touchdown,” Nix said.              The Chiefs won't play again until Jan. 18 or 19, meaning Mahomes, who last played on Christmas Day, and other stars who sat this one out will have at least 24 days between games.              Denver's playoff drought was the longest for a team after raising the Lombardi Trophy by four years.              The Broncos' clincher came 3,255 days after Von Miller led them to a 24-10 win over the Carolina Panthers on Feb. 7, 2016, and their reward as the AFC's seventh seed is a trip to face Miller next weekend.              “Man, we look forward to the challenge,” Payton said.              The Bills were the only other team to beat Kansas City this season, 30-21 in Week 11.               The Chiefs' loss ended their six-game win streak but eliminated the prospect of them having to possibly face Cincinnati quarterback Joe Burrow at some point in the playoffs.              The Chiefs planned on staying in Denver for the night because of a winter storm that also delayed their flight into Colorado for several hours Saturday. Injuries               Chiefs DB Chamarri Conner (shoulder) was injured in the first half and didn't return. Also sitting out for Kansas City were RB Isiah Pacheco (ribs), RT Jawaan Taylor (knee), CB Jaylen Watson (ankle), WR Mecole Hardman (knee), DE George Karlaftis, CB Trent McDuffie and DT Chris Jones (calf), among others.               The Broncos head into the playoffs as healthy as they've been all season.              ------              AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl

**Las Vegas Raiders 20 - 34 Los Angeles Chargers**  
In a pivotal game, the Los Angeles Chargers clinched the AFC's No. 5 seed with a 34-20 victory over the Las Vegas Raiders, spearheaded by Justin Herbert's stellar performance, which included 346 passing yards and two touchdowns. Herbert's crucial 42-yard run set up a touchdown pass to Will Dissly, and Daiyan Henley's interception late in the first half turned the momentum in the Chargers' favor. This win, marking their first at Las Vegas since 2020 and first season sweep of the Raiders since 2018, came under the leadership of first-year coach Jim Harbaugh, ensuring a three-game winning streak to close the regular season. The Chargers excelled with Quentin Johnston achieving career highs with 13 receptions for 186 yards. Meanwhile, the Raiders concluded their season 4-13 amid uncertainty surrounding coach Antonio Pierce's future. The Chargers now look ahead to face the Houston Texans in the playoffs, while Las Vegas faces important offseason decisions, including the stability of their coaching and quarterback positions.

**Dallas Cowboys 19 - 23 Washington Commanders**  
In a surprising twist, Marcus Mariota led the Washington Commanders to a 23-19 victory over the Dallas Cowboys after replacing an injured Jayden Daniels, helping Washington secure the sixth seed in the NFC playoffs. Mariota's standout performance included throwing two touchdowns and rushing for another, with a decisive 5-yard touchdown pass to Terry McLaurin as time expired. Despite initially trailing, the Commanders mounted an impressive comeback, clinching their playoff spot with a four-game winning streak. Dallas, finishing the season at 7-10, saw a promising start from Trey Lance, who made his first regular-season start since 2022, though ultimately unable to secure a win. Micah Parsons stood out defensively for the Cowboys with 2.5 sacks, reaching double-digit sacks for the fourth consecutive season. As Washington prepares to face the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the wild-card round, the Cowboys await the decision on Mike McCarthy's future as head coach.

**Philadelphia Eagles 20 - 13 New York Giants**  
In the regular-season finale, the Philadelphia Eagles secured a 20-13 victory over the New York Giants, resting key starters, including Jalen Hurts, ahead of their wild-card playoff game against Green Bay. Saquon Barkley, who ended the season with 2,005 rushing yards, sat out, missing a chance to break Eric Dickerson’s single-season rushing record. With rookie Tanner McKee impressively stepping up, throwing for 269 yards and two touchdowns, the Eagles solidified their 14-3 record and No. 2 seed status in the NFC, setting up a playoff rematch against the Packers, whom they previously defeated in Brazil. Meanwhile, the Giants, struggling at 3-14, missed a shot at the top draft pick, and questions linger about Head Coach Brian Daboll’s future with the team.

**Detroit Lions 31 - 9 Minnesota Vikings**  
The Detroit Lions secured a dominant 31-9 victory over the Minnesota Vikings, clinching the NFC North title for the second consecutive year and earning the No. 1 seed in the playoffs for the first time in franchise history. Jahmyr Gibbs had a standout performance, scoring four touchdowns, including three in the second half, to propel Detroit to a win and ensure a first-round bye and home-field advantage in the playoffs. The Lions' quarterback, Jared Goff, overcame two interceptions by orchestrating crucial drives, while the Vikings struggled in the red zone, failing to convert key opportunities into touchdowns. Despite their loss, the Vikings remain in the playoffs and will face the Los Angeles Rams in the wildcard round. The game marked the first time two teams with a combined 28 victories played in a regular-season finale to decide the No. 1 seed, with Detroit hoping to end a championship drought dating back to 1957.

**Green Bay Packers 22 - 24 Chicago Bears**  
In a dramatic finish to a challenging season, the Chicago Bears rallied to defeat the Green Bay Packers 24-22 at Lambeau Field, snapping an 11-game losing streak against their divisional rivals. Quarterback Caleb Williams, the top pick in the 2024 draft, led the Bears to victory by setting up Cairo Santos' game-winning 51-yard field goal as time expired. This marked Chicago's first win over Green Bay since 2018 and their first win at Lambeau since 2015. The Bears also deployed an inventive punt return trick that resulted in a 94-yard touchdown by Josh Blackwell. The Packers, now limping into the playoffs as the NFC's No. 7 seed, lost key players Jordan Love and Christian Watson to injuries during the game. Despite these setbacks, Green Bay managed a late lead with a 55-yard field goal by Brandon McManus, but they ultimately fell short. Interim coach Thomas Brown commended Chicago's resilience, emphasizing Santos' redemption from a previous blocked field goal against the Packers. Meanwhile, the Packers prepare for their playoff matchup against Philadelphia, with hopes that Love will be ready to return despite his injury.

**Arizona Cardinals 47 - 24 San Francisco 49ers**  
Kyler Murray led the Arizona Cardinals to a season-ending victory over the San Francisco 49ers with 242 passing yards and four touchdowns, including a decisive 12-yard pass to rookie Marvin Harrison Jr., sealing a 47-24 win. Harrison tied the franchise rookie record for touchdown catches, previously shared by Larry Fitzgerald and Anquan Boldin. The Cardinals ended the season 8-9, an improvement from last year, while the 49ers, who finished 6-11, missed the playoffs following their previous Super Bowl appearance. Notable moments included a brawl leading to the ejections of Jauan Jennings and Sean Murphy-Bunting, and Joshua Dobbs throwing two interceptions for the 49ers. Additionally, Trey McBride set a record for receptions by a tight end for the Cardinals. Arizona's offense was in peak form, scoring their highest point total since 2015, while the game also saw several injuries impacting both teams.
