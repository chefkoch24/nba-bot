**New York Knicks 121 - 113 Boston Celtics**  
The New York Knicks took a commanding 3-1 series lead against the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference semifinals with a 121-113 victory in Game 4. Jalen Brunson was instrumental in the win, contributing 39 points and 12 assists, as the Knicks overcame a halftime deficit and dominated the second half. The game took a dramatic turn with Boston's Jayson Tatum suffering a potentially severe right leg injury late in the fourth quarter, leaving the Celtics in a precarious position as they attempt to make a comeback without their star player. Tatum had scored 42 points before his injury, but the Knicks capitalized with key performances from Mikal Bridges, Karl-Anthony Towns, and OG Anunoby. With this win, the Knicks have a chance to reach the conference finals for the first time in 25 years, needing just one more victory either in Boston on Wednesday or back home at Madison Square Garden. The Celtics now face the challenge of becoming only the 14th team to overcome a 3-1 deficit, a feat not accomplished since Denver in the 2020 playoffs.

**Golden State Warriors 101 - 114 Minnesota Timberwolves**  
In Game 3 of the Western Conference second-round playoff series, the Minnesota Timberwolves triumphed over the Golden State Warriors, taking a 2-1 lead with a 102-97 victory in San Francisco. The Warriors struggled without their star Stephen Curry, who was sidelined with a strained left hamstring. Anthony Edwards was instrumental for Minnesota, scoring 36 points, including a dazzling 15-point performance in the third quarter and contributing three crucial three-pointers in the fourth. Meanwhile, Golden State saw an impressive effort from Jonathan Kuminga, who scored a career-high 30 points, demonstrating his growth alongside mentor Jimmy Butler III. The Warriors’ three-point attempts were their lowest of the postseason at 23, contrasting with Minnesota's effective long-range shooting. As Stephen Curry’s status remains uncertain, the Warriors face a challenging task to even the series against a confident Timberwolves team thriving on both ends of the court.
