**Florida Panthers 1 - 4 Washington Capitals**  
In a tightly contested game at Amerant Bank Arena, Jakob Chychrun's decisive goal early in the third period propelled the Washington Capitals to a 4-1 victory over the struggling Florida Panthers, handing them their fourth consecutive loss.

Nico Hischier netted his first NHL hat trick in the second period, leading the New Jersey Devils to a 5-2 victory over the Nashville Predators at Prudential Center.

Hischier's achievement marks him as the fourth Devils player in 15 years to secure a natural hat trick, highlighting his pivotal role on the team.

**New York Rangers 2 - 5 St Louis Blues**  
In Jim Montgomery's debut as head coach, the St. Louis Blues defeated the New York Rangers 5-2 at Madison Square Garden, marking their first win there since March 2020. Zack Bolduc scored his first two goals of the season, while Brayden Schenn added a goal and an assist, and Joel Hofer made 27 saves. The Blues capitalized on a wide-open third period to secure the win, with Schenn scoring a breakaway goal early to give them a 3-2 lead. Despite giving up their opening goal streak this season (previously 10-0), the Rangers struggled defensively, allowing the Blues to take advantage and ultimately stretch their lead with Bolduc's second goal and a late empty-netter from Pavel Buchnevich. The game was notable for not only Montgomery's successful debut but also as a wake-up call for the Rangers, who have now lost three consecutive games while allowing a large volume of shots on goal.

Ilya Samsonov made 32 saves for the Golden Knights, who have now won three consecutive games. Morgan Frost and Matvei Michkov were notable performers for the Flyers, with Michkov giving his team a 4-2 lead before Vegas tied it up. Despite the Flyers' strong start and Emil Andrae's first NHL goal in his 16th game, they couldn't hold onto the lead, reflecting coach John Tortorella's assessment of a generally good but incomplete performance. Notably, Vegas is unbeaten this season when scoring four or more goals, now holding an 11-0-0 record in such instances.

In a thrilling game at the Lenovo Center, Martin Necas scored a crucial power-play goal late in the third period to help the Carolina Hurricanes secure a 6-4 victory over the Dallas Stars. With the score tied at 4-4, Necas's centering pass deflected off Stars defenseman Ilya Lyubushkin's skate and into the net, giving the Hurricanes the lead. Andrei Svechnikov added an empty-net goal in the final seconds for insurance. Sebastian Aho was a standout performer with a goal and three assists, while Seth Jarvis, returning from injury, contributed a goal and two assists for the Hurricanes. Despite the Stars' strong 5-on-5 play, as noted by their coach Pete DeBoer, their special teams struggled, conceding two power-play goals. Dallas players Tyler Seguin, Mason Marchment, and Miro Heiskanen each had a goal and an assist, but it wasn't enough to prevent the end of Jake Oettinger's five-game winning streak. The victory marked Carolina's eighth consecutive home win.

Key contributors for the Senators included Drake Batherson and Brady Tkachuk, each with a goal and an assist, while Cole Reinhardt scored his first NHL goal shortly after being called up from the AHL. The Senators capitalized on their power-play opportunities, scoring twice in nine chances, which proved pivotal, given the Flames' struggle with penalties throughout the game. Despite scoring the opening goal and a late push with Mikael Backlund's goal, the Flames were hindered by a series of penalties, as highlighted by Calgary's coach Ryan Huska, who noted the difficulty of maintaining momentum with frequent penalty kills. Ottawa's resilient performance was underscored by coach Travis Green, who emphasized the team's focus on playing a solid and straightforward game to secure the win.

**Minnesota Wild 1 - 4 Winnipeg Jets**  
In a commanding performance, Winnipeg Jets goalie Connor Hellebuyck made 43 saves to lead his team to a 4-1 victory over the Minnesota Wild. Despite Minnesota's strong first period, outshooting Winnipeg 22-7, Hellebuyck's exceptional play prevented them from capitalizing on their efforts. Alex Iafallo stood out for the Jets, scoring twice, including his 100th NHL goal. Neal Pionk contributed two assists, and Nino Niederreiter added a goal, helping the Jets earn their seventh consecutive win against the Wild. Notably, Hellebuyck's 15-2-0 start to the season tied the NHL record for the fewest games needed to reach 15 wins. The game also saw Jake Middleton score the Wild's sole goal, while Adam Lowry sealed the victory with an empty-net goal. Despite the loss, Wild coach John Hynes found positives to build on for upcoming games.
