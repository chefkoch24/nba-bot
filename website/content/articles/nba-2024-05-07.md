**New York Knicks 121 - 117 Indiana Pacers**  
Jalen Brunson scored 43 points, becoming the fourth player in NBA history with four straight 40-point games in the postseason, leading the Knicks to a 121-117 victory over the Pacers in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals. Donte DiVincenzo hit the tiebreaking 3-pointer and added 25 points, while Josh Hart contributed a playoff career-high 24 points. Despite strong play from the Pacers' bench, Brunson guided the Knicks through another close finish, outplaying fellow All-Star point guard Tyrese Haliburton. The Knicks will host Game 2 on Wednesday after taking an early lead in a series for the first time since the 2000 East semifinals against Miami.

**Denver Nuggets 80 - 106 Minnesota Timberwolves**  
The Minnesota Timberwolves took a 1-0 series lead over the defending champion Denver Nuggets with a convincing 106-99 victory in Game 1. Timberwolves guard Anthony Edwards shined with 43 points in the game, receiving praise from Nuggets star Nikola Jokic. Denver will look to bounce back in Game 2, possibly without the presence of Rudy Gobert, who is questionable due to personal reasons after becoming a father. The Timberwolves' strong defense and fearless play helped them secure a crucial road win and have the opportunity to go up 2-0 in the series.
