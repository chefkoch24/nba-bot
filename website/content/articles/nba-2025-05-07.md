**Cleveland Cavaliers 119 - 120 Indiana Pacers**  
Tyrese Haliburton delivered a stunning performance by hitting a decisive 3-pointer with just 1.1 seconds left, as the Indiana Pacers rallied to defeat the top-seeded Cleveland Cavaliers 120-119, seizing a 2-0 lead in the Eastern Conference semifinals. Haliburton scored 11 of his 19 points in the fourth quarter, including securing a crucial offensive rebound and a subsequent game-winning shot. This dramatic comeback echoed Haliburton's recent playoff heroics, following a game-winning layup against Milwaukee. Myles Turner and Aaron Nesmith also contributed significantly with 23 points each. Despite Donovan Mitchell's impressive 48-point effort for Cleveland, the Cavaliers, missing key injured players, succumbed to Indiana's late-game surge. This marks the first time since 1994 that the Pacers have won their first two games of a playoff series on the road.

**Minnesota Timberwolves 88 - 99 Golden State Warriors**  
In the opening game of the second-round series, the Golden State Warriors secured a victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves, 99-88, despite an early exit by Stephen Curry due to a hamstring strain. Buddy Hield and Draymond Green stepped up in Curry's absence, with Hield scoring 24 points and hitting five 3-pointers, while Green contributed four first-half 3-pointers on his way to 18 points. The Warriors' robust defense, enhanced by a strategic zone approach from coach Steve Kerr, capitalized on the Timberwolves' dismal 3-point shooting—going 5 for 29 from beyond the arc. Jimmy Butler's near triple-double performance and Anthony Edwards' double-double weren't enough to offset Minnesota’s shooting woes. The Timberwolves missed their first 16 attempts from 3-point range, managing a comeback only when trailing significantly in the third quarter. As the series progresses, all eyes will be on Curry's availability for Game 2 on Thursday, with home teams yet to secure a victory in this playoff round.
