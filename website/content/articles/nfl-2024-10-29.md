**Pittsburgh Steelers 26 - 18 New York Giants**  
In a thrilling "Monday Night Football" matchup, the Pittsburgh Steelers edged past the New York Giants 26-18, largely thanks to Calvin Austin III's standout performance. Austin, motivated by coach Mike Tomlin's pep talk, scored two crucial touchdowns—a 73-yard punt return and a 29-yard catch—to lift the Steelers. Despite the game being marred by a slew of penalties and negated touchdowns, Pittsburgh's defense, led by T.J. Watt’s decisive strip-sack, secured the victory. Steelers' QB Wilson returned from injury to throw for 278 yards, while Najee Harris rushed for over 100 yards for the third consecutive game. The win marks Pittsburgh's 22nd consecutive home victory on a Monday night, propelling them to the top of the AFC North as they head into their bye week. Conversely, the Giants, undermined by penalties and mistakes, dropped to 2-6, continuing their struggles despite flashes of potential from rookie Tyrone Tracy’s impressive rushing display.
